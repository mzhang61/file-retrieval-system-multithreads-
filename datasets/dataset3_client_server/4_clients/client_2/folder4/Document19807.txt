[Transcriber's Note:

This is an updated version of an e-text originally produced in November
2006; see end of text for additions and corrections.

The e-text consists of two separately published books:

  _Spellings for the Schools in the Chipeway Language_
  _Sketch of Grammar of the Chippeway Language_

In the first book (Spellings...), the hyphen - is used to separate
syllables. In the second book (Grammar...) the hyphen seems to
represent the glottal stop.

In the word lists of the first book, the first entry in each column was
sometimes-- but not consistently-- capitalized. This capitalization has
been retained, whether or not the e-text layout replicates the original.

A few punctuation marks in the paradigms and vocabulary lists have been
supplied or regularized. Other errors and anomalies are listed at the
end of the e-text. Bracketed text is in the original unless otherwise
noted.]

  Sketch of Grammar
  of the
  CHIPPEWAY LANGUAGE,

  To Which Is Added a Vocabulary
  of some of the most common Words.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The following pages were written as an exercise for my leisure hours,
while attending the Oneida Conference Seminary during the past winter.
As it is the first attempt that, to my knowledge, has ever been made to
reduce the Chippeway language to any system, it cannot be expected to be
otherwise than imperfect, and perhaps may hereafter be found to be, in
some respects, erroneous. It is, however, as free from errors as my
present means have enabled me to make it. It has been printed at the
request of my friends, by a fellow student, at his own suggestion and
expense.

J. SUMMERFIELD.

Cazenovia, April 10, 1834.




SKETCH OF GRAMMAR, &c.


The Letters used in the Chippeway Language, are twenty-one, viz.
A, a; B, b; C, c; D, d; E, e; G, g; H, h; I, i; J, j; K, k; M, m; N, n;
O, o; P, p; Q, q; S, s; T, t; U, u; W, w; Y, y; Z, z. F, L, R, V, and X,
are not used.

There are, in the Chippeway Language, ten parts of Speech, namely,
the _article_, the _noun_, the _pronoun_, the _adjective_, the _verb_,
the _participle_, the _adverb_, the _preposition_, the _conjunction_,
and the _interjection_.


OF THE ARTICLE.

There is but one Article, used definitely both in the masculine and
neuter genders, viz. Owh, the, m.; Ewh, the, n.


OF NOUNS.

A Noun is the name of any person, place, or thing; as, Eneneh, man;
Kahdahnahqueeng, Kingston; metig, tree.

Nouns are of two sorts, Common and Proper.

Common Nouns stand for kinds containing many sorts, or for sorts
containing many individuals under them; as, Ahwaseeh, animal; eneneh,
man; kegownh, fish; penaseh, bird.

Proper Nouns are the names appropriated to individuals, as, Charles,
Cazenovia, Ganges. [N.B. Proper names, with a few exceptions, are the
same as in English.]

To Nouns belong gender, person, number, and case.

GENDER.

Gender is the distinction of nouns with regard to sex.

Nouns have three genders, the masculine, the feminine, and the neuter.

The masculine gender denotes males; as, Eneneh, man.

The feminine gender is applied to animals, fishes, and birds; as,
Nahbak, a she bear, &c.

The neuter gender denotes things without sex; as, Wewahquon, a hat.

NUMBER.

Number is the distinction of objects as one or more.

Nouns are of two numbers, the singular and the plural.

The singular number implies but one object; as, Mahzenahegun, a book.

The plural number implies more than one; as, Mahzhenahegahnun, books.

CASE.

Nouns have three cases, the nominative, the possessive, and the
objective.

The nominative case simply expresses the name of a thing, &c.;
as, Owh quewesanceoobahkahmegezeh, the boy plays.

The possessive case expresses the relation of property or possession,
and always ends with the letter _o_; as, Noosayo wegewaum, my father's
house.

The objective case expresses the object of an action or of relation;
as John owejeahn Charles, John assists Charles.

Nouns may be declined in the following manner:

                   Singular.          Plural.
  _Nom. Case_,     Eneneh, man.       Enenewug, men.
  _Poss. Case_,    Eneneho, man's.    Enenewugo, men's.
  _Obj. Case_,     Eneneh, man.       Enenewug, men.


OF PRONOUNS.

A Pronoun is a word used instead of a noun, to avoid repeating the same
word; as, Pahpenatum eneneh, the man is happy; Pahpenatum, he is happy.

PERSONAL PRONOUNS.

There are three personal pronouns, viz. Neen, I; keen, thou; ween, he;
with their plurals, Nenahwind, we; kenahwah, ye or you; wenahwah, they.

Personal pronouns have person, number, gender and case.

The persons of pronouns are three in each number, viz.

  Neen, I, is the first person,        }
  Keen, thou, is the second person,    } Singular.
  Ween, he, is the third person,       }
  Nenahwind, we, is the first person,     }
  Kenahwah, you, is the second person,    } Plural.
  Wenahwah, they, is the third person,    }

_Number._--Pronouns have two numbers, the singular and the plural.

_Case._--Pronouns have three cases, the nominative, the possessive, and
the objective.

Pronouns cannot be declined. The cases of each person have the same
form.

  First person.  _Singular._    _Plural._
      _Nom._     Neen, I.       Nenahwind, we.
      _Poss._    Neen, mine.    Nenahwind, ours.
      _Obj._     Neen, me.      Nenahwind, us.


OF ADJECTIVES.

An Adjective is a word added to a noun to express its quality; as,
quahnoj eneneh, a good man; menwawezheh eneneh, an industrious man.

Adjectives are not varied to agree with their nouns, nor do they have
any regular comparison.

The following is a list of Numeral Adjectives:

OF VERBS.

A Verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer; as,
Nedahyah, I am; Nedebahkoonewa, I rule; Nedebahkoonegoo, I am ruled.

Verbs are of three kinds, active, passive, and neuter.

A Verb Active expresses an action, and necessarily implies an agent
and an object acted upon; as, Nezhahgeah James, I love James.

A Verb Passive expresses passion or a suffering or the receiving of an
action, and implies an object acted upon, and an agent by which it is
acted upon; as, Chezhahwaneding, to be loved; John oojezhahwanemah
neen, John is loved by me.

A Verb Neuter expresses neither action nor passion, but being or a
state of being; as, Nenebah, I sleep; Nenahmahdub, I sit.

Verbs have number, person, mood and tense.

NUMBER AND PERSON.

Verbs have two numbers, the singular and the plural.

There are three persons in each number; as,

  Pers.  _Singular._                   _Plural._
    1.   Nezhahwanega, I love.         Nezhahwanegamin, we love.
    2.   Kezhahwanega, thou lovest.    Kezhahwanegaim, you love.
    3.   Zhawanega, he loves.          Zhahwanegawug, they love.

MOOD.

The moods are five, Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative, Potential, and
the Infinitive.

The Indicative declares or affirms positively, or it asks a question;
as, Zhahwanega, he loves; Zhahwaneganah? Does he love?

The Subjunctive expresses action or passion in a doubtful manner;
as, Kespin zhahwanegaid, if he loves.

The Imperative is used for commanding, exhorting, and entreating;
as, Mahjahn keen, depart thou; Noodahmooyook, do thou listen.

The Potential implies possibility, liberty, power, will; as,
Tahgemewan kahnahbuge, it may rain; Kegahwesenemin kiya kahmenequamin,
we shall eat and drink.

The Infinitive simply expresses the signification of the verb;
as, Cheezechegang, to do; Chegegedoong, to speak.

TENSE.

Verbs have six tenses, the present, the imperfect, the perfect, the
pluperfect, the first and second future tenses.

The present tense represents a present action as taking place at the
time in which it is mentioned; as, Nebop, I laugh; Newob, I see;
Nedenadum, I think.

The imperfect tense denotes past action or event however distant,
finished, but without defining the exact time of its completion;
as, Oodanongezahbahneeg ahpe naquaskahwod, they were travelling to
the town when he met them.

The perfect tense refers not only to what is past but also conveys
an allusion to the present time; as, Ahzheh negegezhetoon
nemahzhenahegun, I have finished my letter.

The pluperfect tense represents a thing, not only as past, but also
as prior to some other point of time specified in the sentence;
as, Ahzehnegegezhetonahbun letter chebwabedahgweshing, I had finished
my letter before he arrived.

The first future tense represents the action as yet to come, either
with or without respect to the precise time when; as, Owh kezis
tahbemookahum wahbung, the sun will rise to-morrow.

The second future tense represents a future action that will be
accomplished before another future action; as, Negahwesenenahbun
nahwahquaig, I shall have dined at twelve o'clock.

OF THE FORMATION OF WORDS.


It is difficult with us to speak the words themselves.--The words
_odoon_, _onik_, _okod_, _ozid_, _okun_, do not mean respectively,
_mouth_, _arm_, _leg_, _foot_, _bone_; but _his mouth_, _his arm_, _his
leg_, _his foot_, _his bone_. By leaving out the letter _o_ we have the
words _mouth_, _arm_, _&c._ themselves: thus, _doon_, _nik_, _kod_,
_zid_, _kun_. The former is the usual way of speaking, the latter is
correct.

By the following illustration it will be better understood how words are
formed:

                        _my_      _thy_ or _your_   _his_
  Nindj,    _a hand_,   nenindj,      kenindj,      onindj,

  Doon,     _a mouth_,  nedoon        kedoon,       odoon,
  Bid,      _a tooth_,  nebid,        kebid,        owebid,
  Daih,     _a heart_,  nedaih,       kedaih,       odaih,
  Kown,     _a liver_,  nekown,       kekown,       okown,
  Kun,      _a bone_,   nekun,        kekun,        okun,
  Skunze,   _a nail_,   neskunze,     keskunze,     oskunze,
  Kod,      _a leg_,    nekod,        kekod,        okod,
  Bowm,     _a thigh_,  nebowm,       kebowm,       obowm,
  Dis,      _a navel_,  nedis,        kedis,        odis,
  Pun,      _a light_,  nepun,        kepun,        opun,
  Zid,      _a foot_,   nezid,        kezid,        ozid,
  Yos,      _flesh_,    neyos,        keyos,        oweyos,
  Yowh,     _a body_,   neyowh,       keyowh,       oweyowh,
  Oose,     _father_,   noose,        koose,        osun,
  Gah,      _mother_,   negah,        kegah,        ogeen,
  Siyahn,   _brother_,  nesiyahn,     kesiyahn,     osiyayun,
  Shema,    _sister_,   neshema,      keshema,      oshemayun,
  Tahwug,   _an ear_,   netahwug,     ketahwug,     otahwug.

_Author of Spelling book:_

I am convinced that 'Spelling' is by Peter Jones, as he was commissioned
to put together a spelling book on June 2, 1828, and presented the
manuscript to a printer in York on June 19, 1828, for the Methodist
Indian Missionary School he ran, which Conference Missionary Society
was a Methodist society. Also, in his book _Life and journals of
Kah-ke-wa-quo-na-by_, in the journal entry for the 19th, it says,
"Arrived at York in the afternoon, and commenced getting a small Indian
spelling book, which I had written, printed at Mr. McKenzie's office."
and considering "Spelling" was only 12 printed pages--3 sheets of
paper--that, I think, does qualify as "a small Indian spelling
book."

_Syncope:_

Several words are presented in a partial syncope form. For example,
_gagiinawishkiwin_ to mean a fib, a lie or a falsehood, in the partial
syncope form is _ggiinawishkiwin_, and the full syncope form is
_ggiinwishkwin_. Summerfield presents this word as _Kenahweskewin,
n. falsehood_, which seems to match the partial syncope form of the
word. However, if this partial syncope is noted, so should the dozen
or so other words shown in partial syncope.

       *       *       *       *       *
           *       *       *       *

each printed line is conjectural. The text is shown here as printed,
with added letters in [brackets]. Line-end hyphens represent word
breaks, not glottal stops.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
