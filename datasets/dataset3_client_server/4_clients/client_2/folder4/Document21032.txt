EXERCISES IN KNITTING.



Receipts for Twelve Chair Covers, in different Patterns.


As the number of stitches required to work each pattern will
be mentioned, these patterns can easily be applied for any other
purpose, and are most of them well adapted for doilies. Some
of the most open patterns are suitable for Shetland shawls; and
as the majority of the chair covers are now done in coloured
wool, the colours and number of shades will be described; though,
if wished in white, the linen thread, No. 1, is the proper material
to be used.




I.

German Pattern of Open Double Knitting, both Sides alike.


Large wooden pins are required for this pattern, which is done
in double or eight-threaded wool, in 5 colours that contrast
well--claret, gold colour, blue, white, scarlet; and 4 rows of
each, worked in the order they are here placed. Cast on 71
stitches.

First row:--Seam 1, make 1, slip 1: this row is only to begin
with, and is not repeated, the whole of the knitting being done
as the

Second row:--Seam 2 together, make 1, by passing the wool
round the pin, slip 1, and repeat. At the end of the row, if
correctly knitted, there will be 1 stitch, which seam. When the
colours have been repeated 6 times, the cover will be the proper size.

To finish it round, work fringe No. 2, work claret for the head,
and put in two lengths of each colour in the fringe.




II.

Nun's Pattern.


Pins No. 10, 8 stitches to a pattern: 14 shades of orange
4-threaded German wool, beginning with the darkest, and working
6 rows of each: 4 plain rows to begin and end the cover; and 4
plain stitches at the beginning and end of every row, for an edge.
These edge stitches are not mentioned with the pattern, but will
be included in the number cast on. Cast on 112 stitches.

First row:--Make 1, knit 1, make 1, knit 2, slip 1, knit 2
together, pass the slipped stitch over, knit 2, and repeat.

times in every other row, till you have 16 stitches between every
increased stitch. Then knit a plain row.

throughout the row, cast off 12 stitches on each side of your pins,

Continue the plain and increased row alternately, in the
whole making 30 rows.

When the hood is made up, satin ribbon is first run between
the holes, and then turned back, and stuffed with wool. It is
turned over to the second of the 8 plain rows. Satin ribbon is
run between the 3 rows of holes and the increased parts down the
crown, which is sewed up. The curtain, or frill, is sewed to the
back part, and is knit as follows:--Cast on 64 stitches, knit 18
plain rows, then take up the stitches at each side, and knit a plain
row; bring the wool forward, and knit 2 together for the row, 1
plain row, cast off, then draw the ribbon through the holes, and
sew on the frill. The crown is neatly lined with white Persian,
and strings of sarcenet added. A rosette of ribbon is an improvement.
Pink, white, or blue wool, is the best colour to knit this
hood in.

Baby's Shoe and Stocking.


Set on 80 stitches, and knit the top as the Swiss mittens.
When deep enough, diminish your stitches to 60. Knit 2 seamed
rows in colour, then 2 plain white, and 6 rows of bars, formed by
knitting 2 plain and 2 seamed stitches alternately for 3 rows, and
then 2 plain rounds, then reverse the ribbing, and so on, with 2
plain rounds between. Divide the back and front--on the 2 back
pins 32 stitches, 28 on the front; on the back pins knit 2 more
plain rows, on the front continue the bars 6 more rows, and at
the end knit 4 plain rows. This finishes the stocking part.

For the shoe, set on 32 stitches of coloured wool on a separate
pin: 1 plain row, and 1 row of holes for ribbon to go through,
1 plain row, and then join it to the back part of the stocking,
knit 2 seamed rows, 2 plain, 3 rows of bars, and 2 seamed rows.
Divide for the heel 12 stitches on the middle pin, and 10 on each
side, which you bind down. Continue 3 plain rows on the middle
part where there are 12 stitches, and 3 rows of bars; no plain rows
at the end; take up each side of the heel 10 stitches, and seam 3
rows. For the foot part, knit 2 plain rows, and 8 rows of bars,
before knitting the plain rows to these 8 rows of bars. Set on 28
stitches of coloured wool on a separate pin, and after knitting 2
seamed rows, join it to the front part of the stocking, then knit
2 plain rounds all round to join the whole, but in the back
part reduce 4 stitches to make it equal with the 28 in front.
Commence the pattern or bars on the back pin, and make the 1st
stitch a plain one, at the end of that pin, and on the front one
seam 3 stitches to form the side of the shoe, with 2 plain rows
as before, narrowing at the end and beginning of the pins. At the
beginning of the pins, narrow the 1st stitch, and at the end before
the 3 seamed stitches, and only narrow in the plain rows. When
you have narrowed to have 10 on the front and back pins, 20 in
all, knit 4 plain rows, and finish by turning it and binding down.
The front part of the shoe should have 4 rows of bars; join the
sides of the shoe and stocking, and knit 4 seamed rows; draw a
ribbon through the back part where you made the holes.




Shell Pattern for a Baby's Cap.


Pins No. 22, and the finest linen thread.

The front part is knit with 2 needles only. Cast on 208 stitches,
knit 5 rows plain for the beginning. After these 5, you must
diminish 1 stitch in every shell, so as to have only 192. Then 3
rows of the pattern, or shells, 2 rows of holes (for putting narrow
ribbon in) before doing the pattern again, which is done in this
manner: bring your thread forward, knit 2 stitches together, and
so on to the end of your needle. Knit 5 rows of plain between
these 2 rows of holes; when this is concluded, knit 4 rows of the
shells, and then 2 rows of the holes the same as before, with the
5 plain rows between, then again 2 rows of the pattern or shells.
You now take your two other needles, and increase 43 stitches for
the back of the head; 2 rows plain, 1 row for putting ribbon in,
and 3 rows plain, then knit 8 rows of the shells; the 7th row you
must have 7 holes in each shell, and the 8th but 6. After this,
seam the first and second stitches, knit the third plain, without
taking it off, and twist it so as to make 2 stitches of this last
one; then seam the fifth, slip the sixth without knitting, knit the
seventh plain, and pass the sixth over, knit the eighth plain, slip
the ninth, and the tenth knit plain, and pass the ninth over it.
The next row: seam the first stitch, slip the second, knit the
third, and pass the second over without taking it off, and knit it
twisted; twist the fourth, seam the fifth, and knit the 3 remaining
plain. After this row, knit 2 rows plain all round; after these,
make a row of holes (for putting ribbon in) by taking 2 stitches
together, and making one as before. First 3 rows plain all round,
another row of holes, and then 3 rows plain. Then do the pattern
8 shells round the cap, and so continue until you have but 5
stitches instead of 9 (not including the 2 twisted, and the seamed).

After this row, seam the 1st, twist the 2d and 3d, seam the 4th,
raise a stitch by picking up a loop, slip the 5th, knit the 6th, and
pass the 5th over, knit the 7th plain, and take the 8th and 9th
together, raise one stitch before beginning to seam.

The next row:--Seam the 1st, slip the 2d, knit the 3d plain,
and pass the 2d half through, and knit it plain, seam the 4th,
knit the 5th plain, slip the 6th without knitting, knit the 7th,
and pass over the 6th to the left, and the 8th to the right, knit
the 9th plain.

Then do 2 rows of plain knitting all round, 2 rows of the holes
(for ribbon), knitting 2 rows plain to divide them, and 4
plain rows to finish with. Take off your stitches on a needle
with coarse thread, and tie it up.

The pattern stitch:--First row:--Seam the 1st stitch, twist the
2d and 3d, seam the 4th, knit the 5th plain, bring your thread
forward, and so continue for 9 stitches plain, counting the 5th for
1; by putting your thread forward, you will have 17 stitches.

Second row:--Seam the 1st stitch, twist the 2d and 3d, seam
the 4th, and knit the 17 plain when with 4 needles, and seam
them when with 2.

Third row:--Seam the 1st, twist the 2d and 3d, seam the 4th,
slip the 5th, knit the 6th plain, and pass over the 5th; knit 15
stitches plain, including the 6th, and take 2 together at the
15th.

Fourth row:--The same as the 3d, with the exception of the
number, which is 13 this time, diminishing at the first and
thirteenth as before.

Fifth row:--The same as the fourth row, only 11 stitches instead
of 13.

Sixth row:--The same as the fifth, only 9 stitches instead of 11.

After the 6 rows, you begin at the first again, the 6 rows
comprising all the pattern.




For a Knitted Bodice.


Five ounces of four-thread fleecy, and No. 10 pins.

Cast on 60 stitches, and knit 3 plain rows.

Fourth row:--Make a stitch, knit 2 together, make a stitch,
knit 2 together, and so on to the end of the row; knit 4 plain
rows, knit 70 rows in double knitting, knit the 4 first and last
stitches of every row plain, then let off all the stitches on to
a piece of thread, except 25 on the right-hand side. *Knit these
25 stitches backwards and forwards (remembering that the 4 plain
stitches are still to be knit on the right-hand side, but not on
the other) for 26 rows; then cast on 15 additional stitches; the 4
plain stitches are now to be knit on both sides for 74 rows. Knit
3 plain rows.

Next row:--Make a stitch, knit 2 together, make a stitch, knit
2 together, and so on, knit 3 plain rows, and cast off. This
completes the back and one front. You then let off 25 stitches
on the other side, and repeat from the point marked above with
an asterisk. Then take up the stitches all round the neck, and
knit 3 plain rows.

Next row:--Make a stitch and knit 2 together alternately, knit
4 plain rows, and cast off. Then sew the two fronts to the back,
about one third of the length up, and run a ribbon through the
row of holes formed at the top and bottom. This is worn outside
the dress; and under a shawl or cloak is very comfortable. All
should be done in double knitting but the 4 edge stitches.




Pretty Open Pattern.


Nine stitches to a pattern. For the centre of a shawl I have
done it in white, with a deep shaded border in feather stitch,
in German wool, and the effect is extremely good.

together, make 1, and repeat.

Second row:--Seam 7, and knit 2 alternately.

pass the slipped stitch over, make 1, knit 2, and repeat.

Sixth row:--Knit 2, and seam 7 alternately.




Shell Knitting for a Bag, in German Wool.


Pins No. 14. Take 11 shades of wool, begin with the darkest,
and 4 rows of each shade; that is, 1 pattern done of each. Cast
on 155 stitches, 57 on 2 of the needles, and 38 on the third.

First round:--Knit 4 stitches plain. Bring the wool forward,
knit 1, bring the wool forward, knit 1. Repeat this 8 times.
Knit 4 plain, seam 3. Repeat this all round.

Second round:--Knit 2 plain, 2 together, 15 plain, slip 1, knit
1, draw the slipped one over the knitted one, knit 3 plain, seam 4.
Repeat this all round.

Third round:--Knit 2 plain, 2 together, 14 plain, slip 1, and
pull 1 over as before, knit 2 plain, seam 3.

Fourth round:--Knit 1 plain, 2 together, 14 plain, slip and pull
over as before, knit 1, seam 3.

Fifth round:--Knit 2 together, 14 plain, slip and pull over,
seam 3.

The stitches will now be reduced to their original number. Tie
on the next shade, and repeat the 5 rows as before. Repeat this
15 times. Then take very small needles, and knit a binder, in
simple ribs, in any of the shades, 15 rows deep.

The handle is made by knitting on 2 needles of the same size
as those used for the bag, with double wool, in the following
manner:--Cast on 14 stitches, slip 1, bring the wool forward,
slip 1, knit 1, pull the slipped one over the knitted one to the
last 2, which are both knitted; without bringing the wool forward,
fold the two edges into the middle, and sew together with the
double wool. Silk tassels to match.




Pretty Pattern for Basket Serviettes.


Six stitches to a pattern. Cast on 76 stitches, knit 2 plain
at each edge.

First row:--Make 1, knit 1, make 1, knit 2 together, knit 1,
knit 2 together.

Second row:--Seamed.

Third row:--Make 1, knit 3, make 1, knit 3 together.

Fourth row:--Seamed.

Oriental Mat, or Hookah Carpet.


This may also be used as a carriage rug, or is very pretty as a
mat for the front of the piano.

It is composed of an open stripe of dark knitting, and a stripe
of white knitting, with a pattern worked in cross stitch on it,
and is quite new. Large wooden pins are required, and 12-threaded
fleecy, dark claret for the open stripe, and white, with 4 shades of
gold, green, lilac, and scarlet, form a good combination of colours
for the close stripe, and are extremely rich in their effect. For
the open stripe cast on 18 stitches.

First row:--Knit 2 stitches, bring the wool forward, pass the
first of the 2 knit stitches over, knit 2, bring the wool forward,
pass the first of the 2 knit stitches over, repeat.

Second row:--Seamed: repeat these 2 rows alternately till you
have done the length you wish your mat to be.

For the close stripe cast on 20 stitches, and knit the same length
as the open stripe. When finished, pin it on to a weighted cushion
to work the pattern on it, as that stretches the knitting, and shews
more plainly where you should put your needle in.

Then work the annexed pattern on it. First pattern in shades
of gold; second, shades of green; third, shades of scarlet; fourth,
shades of lilac. Repeat with the gold. Four stripes of the white,
and 3 of the dark, will make a nice-sized mat for a drawing-room.
If for a carriage rug, an additional stripe of each.

[Image: Pattern for Oriental mat.]




Very elegant Knitted Pelisse.


This may be made either smaller or larger by using finer or
coarser wool and pins.

It is usually done in 4-thread fleecy, with coloured centre, and
border to imitate ermine.

Cast on 270 stitches with white, bring the wool forward, slip a
stitch the reversed way, knit 2 together, and repeat: every row is
alike. Knit 24 rows with the white, then slip off 24 stitches at
the beginning of the next row, and join the coloured wool, leave
24 stitches at the other end. These stitches are not required again
till the centre is done, and are then knitted in white to form the
border up the sides: this will leave 222, knit with these, with the
coloured wool for 12 rows.

Next row:--Knit 27, bring the wool forward, slip 1, and instead
of knitting only 2 together, knit 5 together: this decreases 1 rib.
Knit to within 30 stitches of the end, decrease 1 rib as before, knit
13 rows, and decrease 1 rib at the beginning and end of the next
row as before: each decreasing is done at the beginning of the row
after knitting 27 stitches, and when within 30 of the end; knit
11 rows, and decrease 1 rib at each end of the next row; knit 13
rows, and decrease 1 rib at each end; knit 13 rows.

Next row:--Knit 27 stitches, decrease 1 rib; knit 6 stitches,
decrease 1 rib; knit 6 stitches, decrease again; knit and repeat,
decreasing after every 6 stitches, till 14 ribs are decreased; knit
the 30 last stitches without decreasing; knit 24 rows without
decreasing.

Next row:--Knit 27 stitches on to another needle, and knit
them backwards and forwards for 42 rows: then cast off 3 stitches
at the end nearest the centre, knit 2 rows, cast off 3 more stitches,
knit 2 rows, and cast off 3 more stitches, till only 9 stitches are
left, then cast off the 9 stitches; this completes 1 front, except
the white, which will be mentioned below. The 27 last stitches are
knitted in the same manner for the other front; then the stitches
that remain for the back are knitted for 42 rows; then cast off 3
stitches at each end, knit 2 rows, and cast off 3 at each end, till
you have cast off 18 at each end, knit 2 plain rows, and cast off
the remainder of the stitches; then sew the shoulders very loosely,
or it will contract them. The 24 stitches of white that were let
off to another pin must be knit on each side the length of the
front, and neatly sewed to it.

For the sleeves:--Cast on 66 stitches, and knit 78 rows: this
is for the coloured part, and in sewing it together at the elbow, it
must be rather tightened; and for the cuff, which is done in white,
cast on 18 stitches and knit 66 rows, and sew it very nicely to the
coloured part.

For the collar:--Cast on 120 stitches with white, knit 8 rows.

Next row:--Knit to within 12 stitches of the end, turn back,
and knit to within 12 of the other end.

Next row:--Leave 6 more stitches at each end.

Next row:--Leave 24 stitches at each end, then 33, 39, 45, and
48 stitches, turning back between each as before, knit to the end
of the row with white, join the coloured wool, knit 8 rows.

Next row:--Leave 12 stitches at the end, turn back, and leave
the same number at the other end.

Next row:--Leave 18, then 24, 30, 36, and 42, at each end,
then 2 rows of coloured, knitting the whole number of stitches,
then cast off, and sew it to the neck.

A cord of tassels for the neck and waist, made of the white
and coloured wool, to be added, and little tufts of black wool
sewed into the white border at equal distances, completes this
elegant pelisse.




Half Cap for Wearing under a Bonnet.


Pins No. 14. Cast on 119 stitches, knit 2 plain rows with the
coloured wool, join the white, and knit 2 plain rows.

Next row:--Make a stitch, seam 2 stitches together, make a
stitch, seam 2 together, and so on; knit another plain row of
white, knit 2 plain rows of coloured, then join the white.

This finishes the border round the top of the cap.

First row:--Knit 4 plain stitches, make a stitch, knit 3 stitches
together, make a stitch, knit 4 plain stitches, make a stitch, knit
3 stitches together, make a stitch, knit 4 plain stitches, and so on
to the end of the row.

Second row:--Seamed.

Third row:--Knit the same as the first, and continue with
these 2 rows alternately for 10 rows, then slip off 28 stitches
on to another needle, then knit the remaining stitches backwards
and forwards for 16 rows, increasing 1 stitch at the beginning of
each of the last 8 rows, join the coloured wool and knit 2 plain
rows, then 2 rows of white.

Next row:--Make a stitch, seam 2 together, make a stitch,
seam 2 together, and so on; knit 1 plain row of white, then take
up the 28 stitches at the back, and the stitches on each side, knit
2 plain rows of coloured all round, and cast off the stitches.
Then run a ribbon, of the same colour as the wool, through the
holes of the border round the back and front of the cap.




For a Muff.


Cast on 80 stitches with the lightest shade, and knit 3 plain
rows: in the fourth row pass the wool round the pin, seam 2
stitches together, pass the wool round the pin, seam 2 together,
and so on to the end of the row; join the next lightest shade, and
knit 3 plain rows. In the fourth row, seam 2 stitches together,
pass the wool round the pin, seam 2 together, and so on to the end
of the row. Continue in this manner, knitting 3 plain rows, and
an open row of each shade, till the darkest; then again to the
lightest: this forms 1 stripe, 4 of which are required. The last
stripe should finish with the lightest shade, to correspond with
the beginning. The shading of each stripe must be reversed; thus,
first begin with the lightest shade and knit to the darkest, then
knit from the darkest to the lightest, and then again to the darkest,
and so on. This should be done in double German wool, in five
shades of sable or chinchilla colours, and satin put underneath the
knitting of the same colour.




A Swiss Pattern for the Top of a Mitten or Muffatee.


Cast on 26 stitches on 3 needles. Begin by seaming the first

stitches plain, pass the thread in front of each of the 2 next
stitches and knit them, which increases and makes the holes;
then knit 3 more plain, and decrease again as above; then seam a
stitch; and so on all round: after each round done in this way,
knit a plain round.

Beautiful Pattern for a Scarf.


Five ounces of Shetland wool, or 4 of silk, are required. This
may either be worked with a deep shaded border or all plain;
worked in the fine black Shetland wool or Ardoise silk, it has the
effect of black lace. The patterns both for the border and the
centre may be applied for a variety of purposes, and where beauty
and elegance of pattern are appreciated, they cannot fail to be
admired.

For the border, cast on 130 stitches; 2 are kept for each edge,
which are not mentioned in the pattern; they are knit and seamed
every alternate row. No. 11 pins for Shetland wool, and No. 12
for Ardoise, are good sizes. Nine stitches form the pattern; so,
if wished wider or narrower, either add or take off 9 stitches.

knit the border, as on the other side. A pretty fringe for this
scarf is 3 rows netted with double silk, on a mesh of this width
----,[2] and 1 row on a mesh 3 inches wide, netting 3 stitches into
each loop.

[2] Transcriber's note: in the source text, this dash is eight

A Pretty Pattern for a Baby's Shoe.


Cast on 30 stitches, knit 8 rows, increasing 1 at the beginning
of each, knit 12 rows, increasing 1 at the beginning of every other
row for the toe, knit 4 rows without increasing. You will now
have 44 stitches on the needle; let off 32 on to a third needle,
and knit the remaining 12 stitches backwards and forwards for 30
rows, cast on 32 stitches, knit 4 rows, knit 12 rows, decreasing
1 at the beginning of every other at the same end that you before
increased, knit 8 rows, decreasing 1 at the beginning of every row;
cast off. This completes the foot part, except the little bit that is
let in to shape it better, for which take up 12 stitches along the
increased part of the toe, and knit 10 rows, decreasing 1 at the
beginning of every other one at the end nearest the casting on.

For the instep:--Take up the 32 stitches on each side, and 16
across the toe, knit 2 plain rows all round, and cast off; then
take up the same number all round, but from the bottom of these
2 rows, and knit 2 rows all round; then place the 32 stitches on
each side on to separate needles. With the 16 stitches across the
toe, knit 2 plain rows, taking up one of the 32 stitches at the end
of each row, and knitting it together with the last stitch.

Next row:--Knit 2, slip 1, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over
the knitted one, bring the thread forward, knit 1, bring the thread
forward, seam 1, pass the thread back, slip 1, knit 1, pass the
slipped stitch over the knitted one, bring the thread forward, knit
1, bring the thread forward, seam 1, pass the thread back, slip 1,
knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted one, bring the
thread forward, knit 1, bring the thread forward, seam 1.

Next row:--Knit 2 plain stitches at each edge, and seam the
remaining stitches. Continue the pattern and plain rows alternately
till 24 rows are done, remembering to knit 1 of the side stitches
with the last of each row; then take the stitches on each side on
to the same needle with the centre ones, and knit 5 plain rows.

Next row:--Make a stitch, seam 2 together, make a stitch,
seam 2 together; this is to form a row of holes for the ribbon to
pass through; knit 2 plain rows. Continue the plain and pattern
rows as in the instep till 36 rows are done; knit 4 plain rows,
and cast off.

Fan-Pattern Knitting for a Mitten.


Needles No. 19, and fine black netting silk. Set 30 stitches on
each of 3 needles; and, after knitting a top either in ribs or any
other pattern, begin the fan, by seaming the first stitch; the
second stitch plain, except that you take the outside part of the
stitch; seam the third; knit the fourth quite plain; bring the
thread in front of the next 6 stitches, and knit them, which makes
13 stitches. With the fourth you knit plain, then seam again, as
at first, and so on for 1 round.

Second round:--Seam the 3 first stitches, as at the beginning,
and wherever you did in the first round; knit the other 13 stitches
quite plain.

Third round:--Seam the 3 first stitches, as in the first round,
slip the fourth stitch, knit the next, and bring the slipped stitch
over them; knit the others plain, till you come to the 2 last before
the seamed stitch; then with your left-hand needle take off the
last knit stitch, and bring the one from behind over that, which
decreases 2 with the one you did after seaming, and so on for 1
round, and every other, till you have reduced the 13 stitches to 7;
then begin again the first round.

It is well to count the stitches frequently, that you may have
them even, allowing 3 for the ribs and 7 plain, whenever you begin
the fan, so that there will be 3 fans on each needle. When you
have 4 or 5 rounds of fans, begin the thumb by bringing the silk
forward, and knitting a stitch, which increases 1; then knit a plain
stitch, and increase the same as before. This do every other row,
till you have as many as you think enough--say 30 stitches; leave
the 30 stitches, and go on with the hand part, and finish that off
at the top; after, knit the thumb. Observe, in increasing, to bring
your silk directly over the stitch you increased to the right hand;
and to the left, knit over, and bring the silk in front of the stitch
after the increased.




Corkscrew Muffatees.


Five skeins of German wool are required for each: the 2 first
and last should be alike, the middle one white. Cast on 24 stitches
on each of 3 needles.

First round:--Seam 3 stitches and knit 3, seam 3 and knit 3.
Continue this for 2 rounds; then knit 3 rounds, knitting the 2
first and last on each needle plain; the intermediate ones, 3 plain
and 3 seamed as before.

The next 3 rounds:--Knit the 1st and 2 last stitches plain, with
3 seamed and 3 knit between them. Three rounds of 3 stitches
plain and 3 seamed. Then 3 rounds, the first 2 and last stitches
seamed, and the middle 3 plain, and 3 seamed. Then seam the
first and last 2 stitches of the next 3 rounds, and begin the whole
pattern again, only knitting 3 rounds instead of 2, as at first,
of 3 seamed and 3 plain.

Receipt for a Stocking.


No. 10 Mee's Persian thread, and needles No. 22, are the proper
sizes. Cast on 56 stitches on the first needle, and 48 on each
of the other 2. Knit 1 row plain. Second row: knit 40 stitches
plain, seam a stitch, knit all round plain. Knit 12 rows in the
same way, all plain but the seam-stitch. Now the pattern begins:
seam a stitch, knit 23 plain, seam a stitch, knit 15 plain. This
will bring you to the centre seam-stitch. Seam this stitch, and
knit 15 plain. This brings you to the end of the first needle.
Seam a stitch, knit 23 plain, seam a stitch, knit 23 plain. This
will end the second needle. Seam a stitch, knit 23 plain, seam a
stitch, knit 23 plain. This ends the third needle. Seam a stitch,
knit 6 plain stitches, bring the cotton forward, knit 1, bring the
cotton forward and knit 1. Continue to bring the cotton forward
and knit 1 till you have made 12 additional stitches. Knit 5 plain,
seam a stitch, knit 15, seam a stitch, knit 15. (This is the back
of the stocking, and must always be knit the same--15 plain, 1
seamed, and 15 plain.) Seam a stitch, knit 6 plain, bring the
cotton forward, and knit 1. Continue this till you have made 12
additional stitches, as before. Knit 5, seam a stitch, knit 6,
bring the cotton forward, and make 12 stitches as before. Knit 5,
seam a stitch, knit 6, make 12 stitches as before. Knit 5, seam a
stitch, knit 6, make 12 as before, and knit 5. This finishes the
row; and you have 60 additional stitches for the pattern. Seam
a stitch and knit 35 plain, seam a stitch and knit the back of
the stocking, seam a stitch and knit 35, seam and knit 35, seam
and knit 35, seam and knit 35. This ends the row. Knit 2 rows
more same as the last. You have now made stitches enough for
the pattern, and begin it. First row: seam a stitch, knit 2
together 6 times, bring the cotton forward, and knit 1. Continue
this till you have 11 holes made. Bring the cotton forward and
slip a stitch, knit a stitch, pull the slipped stitch over the
knitted one, slip a stitch, knit a stitch, pull the slipped stitch
over the knitted one. Continue to slip a stitch, knit a stitch,
and pull the slipped one over it 4 times more, which should bring
you to the seam-stitch. Knit the back of the stocking, and continue
this pattern round the other two needles, which will conclude the row.
The next 3 rows are knit plain, except the seam-stitches, which must
be attended to. This finishes the pattern; and you begin again at
the first row, and repeat the pattern 45 times. You then begin
the heel: knit the seam-stitch on the 1st needle plain, then knit
the pattern-row of the stripe; knit the back of the stocking and
knit the 1st stripe off of the next needle, (using the needle
you have knit the stripe and the back of the stocking with,)
remembering that this is the pattern-row; knit the seam-stitch at
the end of the stripe plain. You have now 2 stripes and the plain
back of the stocking on the heel needles, and 3 stripes on the
front of the stocking; with the front you have at present nothing
to do. The first or pattern row of the heel is knit; the remainder
of the heel is to be knit with double thread. Second row: slip a
stitch, seam 35 stitches, knit a plain stitch, seam 15, knit 1 plain,
seam 15, knit 1 plain, seam 36. Third row: slip a stitch, knit
35, seam a stitch, knit 15, seam a stitch, knit 15, seam a stitch,
knit 36. Fourth row: slip 1, seam 35, knit 1 plain, seam 15,
knit 1 plain, seam 15, knit 1 plain, seam 36. Begin again with
the pattern-row, remembering that there is 1 plain stitch at the
beginning and end of each needle, which stitch must be slipped at
the beginning of every row. Repeat this pattern 9 times: at the
10th time slip a stitch, knit 7 double stitches, make 8 holes,
narrowing from the last hole, 7 times, in the same manner as
usual; this will reduce the pattern 6 stitches. For the 11th
time: slip 1, knit 7 double stitches, make 2 holes, narrowing
from the 2d hole in the usual manner; this will have reduced
the heel 14 stitches in each stripe, and finishes the pattern.
Knit 10 plain rows, knitting all the seam-stitches except the
middle one plain. The heel must now be closed; the narrowing must
begin in the row of plain knitting, not the seamed one. Knit 26
stitches, knit 2 together, knit 11 stitches, which brings you to
the seam; knit 11 stitches beyond the seam, slip a stitch, knit a
stitch, pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one, turn back, slip
1 stitch, and seam 11 stitches, knit the seam-stitch plain, seam 11
stitches, seam 2 together, turn back, slip a stitch, knit to the
seam-stitch and 11 stitches beyond, slip a stitch, knit a stitch,
and pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one. Continue this
narrowing till you have knit up all the stitches at each side. Take
up the loops all along the side of the heel (they should be 29),
knit them with the single thread, knitting the 2 last on the needle
together. This begins the gore. Knit the 3 stripes on the front
needle, in the pattern, as usual, only remembering that you have
no seam-stitch between the gore and the pattern; take up the
loops all along the 2d side of the heel, and take half the heel
stitches on the same needle, then slip the 1st stitch, knit the 2d,
pull the slipped stitch over it, knit the remaining stitches on
the needle. There should now be 41 stitches on each of the side
needles. The middle of the heel ends the row, therefore the 1st
needle is the one which begins from that place. Knit 15 stitches
plain, make a stitch by taking up a loop of the last row, knit 3
stitches, make another as before, continue to knit 3 and make 1
till you have increased 11 stitches, which will bring you within
4 stitches of the end of the needle; knit them plain. Knit the
front needle in the 2d row of pattern, knitting 35 and seaming 1,
knitting 35, seaming 1, knitting 35, which ends the needle. Knit
3 stitches, make 1, knit 3 as before, till you have made 11, knit 15
plain, which ends the row. There should now be 51 stitches on
each of the side needles. You must knit to within 2 stitches of
the end of the 1st needle; knit them together. Knit the front
needle in 3d row of pattern. Third needle: slip a stitch, knit a
stitch, pull the slipped stitch over it, knit to the end of the
needle plain. The next row is not to be narrowed at either place.
Continue to narrow the side needles, as directed, every second
row, carrying on the pattern on the front needle, till you have
reduced the stitches on each side needle, the first to 35, and the
second to 36 stitches. There will now be 173 stitches all round.
Continue to knit the side needles plain, and the front in pattern,
till you have repeated the pattern from the beginning of the gore
32 times, join on the second thread, and narrow the pattern 14
stitches in each stripe in the manner directed for the heel. There
will now be 136 stitches on the needles. Knit 8 plain rows. Divide
the stitches exactly, leaving 68 on the front needle, and 34 on
each of the side needles. The first needle of the row is the same
as before. Knit to within 3 stitches of the end, slip 1, knit 1,
pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one, knit 1 plain. Second
needle: knit 1 plain stitch, knit 2 together, knit to within 3
stitches of the end, slip 1, knit 1, pull the slipped stitch over
the knitted one, knit 1 plain. Third needle: knit 1 plain, knit 2
together, knit 1 to the end, knit 1 plain row all round. Continue
these alternate rows till you have reduced the stitches to 88, then
narrow every row, as directed, till there remain only 30 stitches
on the front needle, and 15 on each of the others. Cast off, and
fasten the thread.




For a Brioche.


Either 8-thread German or 3-thread fleecy should be used. Pins
No. 12. Cast on 90 stitches; keep the wool in front, slip a stitch
the reversed way, knit 2 together, pass the wool in front, slip a
stitch the reversed way, knit 2 together, pass the wool in front,
slip a stitch the reversed way, knit 2 together, and so on. The
whole of the knitting is done in this manner; then knit 2 rows of
dark for the edge, 2 rows of the colour for the centre, 2 more
dark: these 6 rows form an edge, which is done on each side of
each piece. Then commence the centre part of the stripe, and knit
2 rows to the end; in the third row, leave 6 stitches at the end, and
turn back, as if beginning a fresh row, and knit to the end; in the
next row, leave 12 stitches; then 18, 24, 30, 36, and 42 stitches;
after leaving 42 stitches, you must only leave 3 more each time
instead of 6; and next leave 45, 48, 51, and so on, until you have
only 15 stitches left; then knit 2 rows of dark (the whole number
of stitches), 2 of the centre colour, 2 of dark; and take it off
like common knitting. This completes 1 piece, 16 of which are
required, and look pretty placed--scarlet, white, blue, gold,
scarlet, white, lilac, green: this forms half the brioche, and
the colours are repeated.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
