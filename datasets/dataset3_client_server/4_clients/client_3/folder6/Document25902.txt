Editor's Note

This Project Gutenberg set of the History of England from the Accession
of James II. were contributed by two volunteeers.  The first volume
appearing in September, 1998  [Etext #1468] and the last in May 2001
[Etext #2614].

All five large volumes have been completely reproofed and corrected.
They have been reposted this week with the addition of an html file for
each which allowed linkage in the texts to the 2800+ footnotes in the
first four volumes.

This present file, a Table of Contents for all five volumes, has
external links to each of the chapters in the entire set.

The contributor of the first volume tabulated a list of the major topics
in each chapter; this seeming a valuable addition, a similar tabulation
has been continued for the remaining five volumes.
