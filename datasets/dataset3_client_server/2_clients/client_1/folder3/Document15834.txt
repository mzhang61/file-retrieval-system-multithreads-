THE BOOK OF JOYOUS CHILDREN


  Bound and bordered in leaf-green,
    Edged with trellised buds and flowers
  And glad Summer-gold, with clean
      White and purple morning-glories
      Such as suit the songs and stories
    Of this book of ours,
  Unrevised in text or scene,--
        The Book of Joyous Children.

  Wild and breathless in their glee--
    Lawless rangers of all ways
  Winding through lush greenery
      Of Elysian vales--the viny,
      Bowery groves of shady, shiny
    Haunts of childish days.
  Spread and read again with me
        The Book of Joyous Children.

  What a whir of wings, and what
    Sudden drench of dews upon
  The young brows, wreathed, all unsought,
      With the apple-blossom garlands
      Of the poets of those far lands
    Whence all dreams are drawn
  Set herein and soiling not
        The Book of Joyous Children.

  In their blithe companionship
    Taste again, these pages through,
  The hot honey on your lip
      Of the sun-smit wild strawberry,
      Or the chill tart of the cherry;
    Kneel, all glowing, to
  The cool spring, and with it sip
        The Book of Joyous Children.

  As their laughter needs no rule,
    So accept their language, pray.--
  Touch it not with any tool:
      Surely we may understand it,--
      As the heart has parsed or scanned it
    Is a worthy way,
  Though found not in any School
        The Book of Joyous Children.


[Illustration: "KNEEL, ALL GLOWING, TO THE COOL SPRING."]


  Be a truant--know no place
    Of prison under heaven's rim!
  Front the Father's smiling face--
      Smiling, that _you_ smile the brighter
      For the heavy hearts made lighter,
    Since you smile with Him.
  Take--and thank Him for His grace--
        The Book of Joyous Children.

AN IMPROMPTU FAIRY-TALE


[Illustration]


  _When I wuz ist a little bit_
      _o' weenty-teenty kid_
  _I maked up a Fairy-tale,_
      _all by myse'f, I did:--_



  I

  Wunst upon a time wunst
    They wuz a Fairy King,
  An' ever'thing he have wuz _gold--_,
    His clo'es, an' _ever_'thing!
  An' all the other Fairies
    In his goldun Palace-hall
  Had to hump an' hustle--
    'Cause he wuz bosst of all!



  II

  He have a goldun trumput,
    An' when he blow' on that,
  It's a sign he want' his boots,
    Er his coat er hat:
  They's a sign fer ever'thing,--
    An' all the Fairies knowed
  Ever' sign, an' come a-hoppin'
    When the King blowed!


[Illustration]



  III

  Wunst he blowed an' telled 'em all:
    "Saddle up yer bees--
  Fireflies is gittin' fat
    An' sassy as you please!--
  Guess we'll go a-huntin'!"
    So they hunt' a little bit,
  Till the King blowed "Supper-time,"
    Nen they all quit.


[Illustration]



  IV

  Nen they have a Banqut
    In the Palace-hall,
  An' ist et! an' et! an' et!
    Nen they have a _Ball_;
  An' when the _Queen_ o' Fairyland
    Come p'omenadin' through,
  The King says an' halts her,--
    "Guess I'll marry you!"

DREAM-MARCH


  "Wasn't it a funny dream!--perfectly bewild'rin'!--
    Last night, and night before, and night before that,
  Seemed like I saw the march o' regiments o' children,
    Marching to the robin's fife and cricket's rat-ta-tat!
  Lily-banners overhead, with the dew upon 'em,
    On flashed the little army, as with sword and flame;
  Like the buzz o' bumble-wings, with the honey on 'em,
    Came an eerie, cheery chant, chiming as it came:--

[Illustration]

  _Where go the children? Travelling! Travelling_!
    _Where go the children, travelling ahead_?
  _Some go to kindergarten; some go to day-school_;
    _Some go to night-school; and some go to bed_!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Smooth roads or rough roads, warm or winter weather,
    On go the children, tow-head and brown,
  Brave boys and brave girls, rank and file together,
    Marching out of Morning-Land, over dale and down:

[Illustration]

  Some go a-gypsying out in country places--
    Out through the orchards, with blossoms on the boughs
  Wild, sweet, and pink and white as their own glad faces;
    And some go, at evening, calling home the cows.

[Illustration]

  _Where go the children? Travelling! Travelling_!
    _Where go the children, travelling ahead_?
  _Some go to foreign wars, and camps by the firelight_--
    _Some go to glory so; and some go to bed_!

[Illustration]

  Some go through grassy lanes leading to the city--
    Thinner grow the green trees and thicker grows the dust;
  Ever, though, to little people any path is pretty
    So it leads to newer lands, as they know it must.
  Some go to singing less; some go to list'ning;
    Some go to thinking over ever-nobler themes;
  Some go anhungered, but ever bravely whistling,
    Turning never home again only in their dreams.

  _Where go the children? Travelling! Travelling_!
    _Where go the children, travelling ahead_?
  _Some go to conquer things; some go to try them_;
    _Some go to dream them; and some go to bed_!

ELMER BROWN


[Illustration]

  Awf'lest boy in this-here town
  Er anywheres is Elmer Brown!
  He'll mock you--yes, an' strangers, too,
  An' make a face an' yell at you,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

[Illustration]

  Yes, an' wunst in School one day,
  An' Teacher's lookin' wite that way,
  He helt his slate, an' hide his head,
  An' maked a face at _her_, an' said,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

[Illustration]

  An' sir! when Rosie Wheeler smile
  One morning at him 'crosst the aisle,
  He twist his face all up, an' black
  His nose wiv ink, an' whisper back,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

[Illustration]

  Wunst when his Aunt's all dressed to call,
  An' kiss him good-bye in the hall,
  An' latch the gate an' start away,
  He holler out to her an' say,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

[Illustration]

  An' when his Pa he read out loud
  The speech he maked, an' feel so proud
  It's in the paper--Elmer's Ma
  She ketched him--wite behind his Pa,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

[Illustration]

  Nen when his Ma she slip an' take
  Him in the other room an' shake
  Him good! w'y, he don't care--no-_sir_!--
  He ist look up an' laugh at her,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

NO BOY KNOWS


  There are many things that boys may know--
  Why this and that are thus and so,--
  Who made the world in the dark and lit
  The great sun up to lighten it:
  Boys know new things every day--
  When they study, or when they play,--
  When they idle, or sow and reap--
  But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

  Boys who listen--or should, at least,--
  May know that the round old earth rolls East;--
  And know that the ice and the snow and the rain--
  Ever repeating their parts again--
  Are all just water the sunbeams first
  Sip from the earth in their endless thirst,
  And pour again till the low streams leap.--
  But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

  A boy may know what a long glad while
  It has been to him since the dawn's first smile,
  When forth he fared in the realm divine
  Of brook-laced woodland and spun-sunshine;--
  He may know each call of his truant mates,
  And the paths they went,--and the pasture-gates
  Of the 'cross-lots home through the dusk so deep.--
  But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

  O I have followed me, o'er and o'er,
  From the flagrant drowse on the parlor-floor,
  To the pleading voice of the mother when
  I even doubted I heard it then--
  To the sense of a kiss, and a moonlit room,
  And dewy odors of locust-bloom--
  A sweet white cot--and a cricket's cheep.--
  But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

WHEN WE FIRST PLAYED "SHOW"


  Wasn't it a good time,
      Long Time Ago--
  When we all were little tads
      And first played "Show"!--
  When every newer day
      Wore as bright a glow
  As the ones we laughed away--
      Long Time Ago!

  Calf was in the back-lot;
      Clover in the red;
  Bluebird in the pear-tree;
      Pigeons on the shed;
  Tom a-chargin' twenty pins
      At the barn; and Dan
  Spraddled out just like "The
      'Injarubber'-Man!"

  Me and Bub and Rusty,
      Eck and Dunk and Sid,
  'Tumblin' on the sawdust
      Like the A-rabs did;
  Jamesy on the slack-rope
    In a wild retreat,
  Grappling back, to start again--
    When he chalked his feet!

[Illustration]

  Wasn't Eck a wonder,
    In his stocking-tights?

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: "JAMESY ON THE SLACK-ROPE."]

       *       *       *       *       *

  Wasn't Dunk--his leaping lion--
    Chief of all delights!
  Yes, and wasn't "Little Mack"
    Boss of all the Show,--
  Both Old Clown and Candy-Butcher--
    Long Time Ago!

  Sid the Bareback-Rider;
    And--oh-me-oh-_my_!--
  Bub, the spruce Ring-master,
    Stepping round so spry!--
  In his little waist-and-trousers
    All made in one,
  Was there a prouder youngster
    Under the sun!

  And NOW--who will tell me,--
    Where are they all?
  Dunk's a sanatorium doctor,
    Up at Waterfall;
  Sid's a city street-contractor;
    Tom has fifty clerks;
  And Jamesy he's the "Iron Magnate"
    Of "The Hecla Works."

  And Bub's old and bald now,
    Yet still he hangs on,--
  Dan and Eck and "Little Mack,"
      Long, long gone!
  But wasn't it a good time,
      Long Time Ago--
  When we all were little tads
      And first played "Show"!

A DIVERTED TRAGEDY


[Illustration]

  Gracie wuz allus a _careless_ tot;
    But Gracie dearly loved her doll,
      An' played wiv it on the winder-sill
  'Way up-stairs, when she ought to _not_,
    An' her muvver _telled_ her so an' all;
      But she won't _mind_ what _she_ say--till,
  First thing she know, her dolly fall
    Clean spang out o' the winder plumb
      Into the street! An' here Grace come
  Down-stairs, two at a time, ist wild
  An' a-screamin', "Oh, my child! my child!"

[Illustration]

  Jule wuz a-bringin' their basket o' clo'es
    Ist then into their hall down there,--
      An' she ist stop' when Gracie bawl,
    An' Jule she say "She ist declare
  She's ist in time!" An' what you s'pose?
      She sets her basket down in the hall,
  An' wite on top o' the snowy clo'es
    Wuz Gracie's dolly a-layin' there
      An' ist ain't bu'st ner hurt a-tall!

[Illustration]

  Nen Gracie smiled--ist _sobbed_ an' smiled--
  An' cried, "My child! my precious child!"

THE RAMBO-TREE


  When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard!--
  The bird sings low as the bumble-bee--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard!--
  The poor shote-pig he says, says he:
  "When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree
  There's enough for you and enough for me."--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard.

  _For just two truant lads like we_,
  _When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree_
  _There's enough for you and enough for me_--
    _It's a long, sweet way across the orchard_.

  When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard!--
  The mole digs out to peep and see--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard!--
  The dusk sags down, and the moon swings free,
  There's a far, lorn call, "Pig-_gee_! 'Pig-_gee_!"
  And two boys--glad enough for three.--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard.

  _For just two truant lads like we_,
  _When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree_
  _There's enough for you and enough for me_--
    _It's a long, sweet way across the orchard_.

FIND THE FAVORITE


  Our three cats is Maltese cats,
    An' they's two that's white,--
  An' bofe of 'em's _deef_--an' that's
    'Cause their _eyes_ ain't right.--

[Illustration]

  Uncle say that _Huxley_ say
    Eyes of _white_ Maltese--
  When they don't match thataway--
    They're deef as you please!

  _Girls, they_ like our white cats best,
    'Cause they're white as snow,
  Yes, an' look the stylishest--
    But they're deef, you know!

  They don't know their names, an' don't
    Hear us when we call
  "Come in, Nick an' Finn!"--they won't
    Come fer us at all!

  But our _other_ cat, _he_ knows
    Mister Nick an' Finn,--
  Mowg's _his_ name,--an' when _he_ goes
    Fer 'em, they come in!

  Mowgli's _all_ his name--the same
    Me an' Muvver took
  Like the Wolf-Child's _other_ name,
    In "The Jungul Book."

  I bet Mowg's the smartest cat
    In the world!--_He's_ not
  _White_, but mousy-plush, with that
    Smoky gloss he's got!

  All's got little bells to ring,
    Round their neck; but none
  Only Mowg _knows_ anything--
    He's the only one!

  I ist 'spect sometimes he hate
    White cats' stupid ways:--
  He won't hardly 'sociate
    With 'em, lots o' days!

  Mowg wants in where _we_ air,--well,
    He'll ist take his paw
  An' ist ring an' ring his bell
    There till me er Ma

  Er _some_body lets him in
    Nen an' shuts the door.--
  An', when he wants out ag'in,
    Nen he'll ring some more.

  Ort to hear our Katy tell!
    She sleeps 'way up-stairs;
  An' last night she hear Mowg's bell
    Ringin' round _some_wheres...

  Trees grows by her winder.--So,
    She lean out an' see
  Mowg up there, 'way out, you know,
    In the clingstone-tree;--

  An'-sir! he ist _hint_ an' _ring_,--
    Till she ketch an' plat
  Them limbs;--nen he crawl an' spring
    In where Katy's at!

THE BOY PATRIOT


  I want to be a Soldier!--
                    A Soldier!--
                        A Soldier!--
  I want to be a Soldier, with a sabre in my hand
  Or a little carbine rifle, or a musket on my shoulder,
  Or just a snare-drum, snarling in the middle of the band;
  I want to hear, high overhead, The Old Flag flap her wings
  While all the Army, following, in chorus cheers and sings;
  I want to hear the tramp and jar
    Of patriots a million,
  As gayly dancing off to war
    As dancing a cotillion.

  _I want to be a Soldier!_--
                    _A Soldier!_--
                        _A Soldier!_--
  _I want to be a Soldier, with a sabre in my hand_
  _Or a little carbine rifle, or a musket on my shoulder_,
  _Or just a snare-drum, snarling in the middle of the band_.

  I want to see the battle!--
                    The battle!--
                        The battle!--
  I want to see the battle, and be in it to the end;--
  I want to hear the cannon clear their throats and catch the prattle
  Of all the pretty compliments the enemy can send!--
  And then I know my wits will go,--and where I _should'nt_ be--
  Well, there's the spot, in any fight, that you may search for me.
  So, when our foes have had their fill,
    Though I'm among the dying,
  To see The Old Flag flying still,
    I'll laugh to leave her flying!

  _I want to be a Soldier!_--
                    _A Soldier!_--
                        _A Soldier!_--
  _I want to be a Soldier, with a sabre in my hand_
  _Or a little carbine rifle, or a musket on my shoulder_,
  _Or just a snare-drum, snarling in the middle of the band_.

EXTREMES


[Illustration]


I

  A little boy once played so loud
  That the Thunder, up in a thunder-cloud,
  Said, "Since I can't be heard, why, then
  I'll never, never thunder again!"

[Illustration]


II

  And a little girl once kept so still
  That she heard a fly on the window-sill
  Whisper and say to a lady-bird,--
  "She's the stilliest child I ever heard!"

INTELLECTUAL LIMITATIONS


  Parunts knows lots more than us,
    But they don't know _all_ things,--
  'Cause we ketch 'em, lots o' times,
    Even on little small things.

  One time Winnie ask' her Ma,
    At the winder, sewin',
  What's the wind a-doin' when
    It's a-not a-_blowin_'?

  Yes, an' 'Del', that very day,
    When we're nearly froze out,
  He ask' Uncle _where_ it goes
    When the fire goes out?

  Nen _I_ run to ask my Pa,
    That way, somepin' funny;
  But I can't say ist but "Say,"
  When he turn to me an' say,
    "Well, what is it, Honey?"

A MASQUE OF THE SEASONS


Scene.--_A kitchen.--Group of Children, popping corn.--The Fairy Queen
of the Seasons discovered in the smoke of the corn-popper.--Waving her
wand, and, with eerie, sharp, imperious ejaculations, addressing the
bespelled auditors, who neither see nor hear her nor suspect her
presence._


QUEEN

  Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall,--
  Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE JASPER

  When I'm dressed warm as warm can be,
        And with boots, to go
        Through the deepest snow,
  Winter-time is the time for me!


QUEEN

  Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall,--
  Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE MILDRED

  I like blossoms, and birds that sing;
      The grass and the dew,
      And the sunshine, too,--
  So, best of all I like the Spring.


QUEEN

  Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall,--
  Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE MANDEVILLE

  O little friends, I most rejoice
      When I hear the drums
      As the Circus comes,--
  So Summer-time's my special choice.


QUEEN

  Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall,--
  Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE EDITH

  Apples of ruby, and pears of gold,
      And grapes of blue
      That the bee stings through.--
  Fall--it is all that my heart can hold!

THOMAS THE PRETENDER


  Tommy's alluz playin' jokes,
  An' actin' up, an' foolin' folks;
    An' wunst one time he creep
  In Pa's big chair, he did, one night,
  An' squint an' shut his eyes bofe tight,
    An' say, "Now I 'm asleep."
  An' nen we knowed, an' Ma know' too,
  He _ain't_ asleep no more 'n you!

[Illustration]

  An' wunst he clumbed on our back'fence
  An' flop his arms an' nen commence
    To crow, like he's a hen;
  But when he failed off, like he done,
  He didn't fool us childern none,
    Ner didn't _crow_ again.
  An' our Hired Man, as he come by,
  Says, "Tom can't _crow_, but he kin _cry_."

LITTLE DICK AND THE CLOCK


  When Dicky was sick
    In the night, and the clock,
  As he listened, said "Tick-
    Atty--tick-atty--tock!"
  He said that _it_ said,
    Every time it said "Tick,"
  It said "Sick," instead,
    And he _heard_ it say "Sick!"
  And when it said "Tick-
    Atty--tick-atty--tock,"
  He said it said "Sick-
    Atty--sick-atty--sock!"
  And he tried to _see_ then,
    But the light was too dim,
  Yet he _heard_ it again--
    And't was _talking_ to him!

  And then it said "Sick-
    Atty--sick-atty--sick
  You poor little Dick-
    Atty--Dick-atty--dock!
  Have you got the hick-
    Atties? Hi! send for Doc
  To hurry up quick
    Atty--quick-atty--quock,
  And heat a hot brick-
    Atty--brick-atty--brock,

  And rikle-ty wrap it
  And clickle-ty clap it
    Against his cold feet-

  No, we don't--'cause we don't know
  _Why_ we got to laughin' so;
  But we got to laughin' so,
      "We ist kep' a-laughin'.

  Wind wuz blowin' in the tree--
  An' wuz only ist us three
  Playin' there; an' ever' one
  Ketched each other, like we done,
  Squintin' up there at the sun
      Like we wuz a-laughin'.

  But I laughed, an' so did they--
  An' we all three laughed, an' nen

THE KATYDIDS


  Sometimes I keep
  From going to sleep,
  To hear the katydids "cheep-cheep!"
  And think they say
  Their prayers that way;
  But _katydids_ don't have to _pray_!

[Illustration]

  I listen when
  They cheep again
  And so, I think, they're _singing_ then!
  But, no; I'm wrong,--
  The sound's too long
  And all-alike to be a song!

  I think, "Well, there!
  I do declare,
  If it is neither song nor prayer,
  It's _talk_--and quite
  Too vain and light
  For me to listen to all night!"

  And so, I smile,
  And think,--"Now I'll
  Not listen for a little while!"--
  Then, sweet and clear,
  Next "_cheep_" I hear
  'S a _kiss_.... Good morning, Mommy dear!

  A-noddin' an' a-bobbin' with his bim! bom! boom!

EVENSONG


  Lay away the story,--
    Though the theme is sweet,
  There's a lack of something yet,
    Leaves it incomplete:--
  There's a nameless yearning--
    Strangely undefined--
  For a story sweeter still
    Than the written kind.

  Therefore read no longer--
    I've no heart to hear
  But just something you make up,
    O my mother dear.--
  With your arms around me,
    Hold me, folded-eyed,--
  Only let your voice go on--
    I'll be satisfied.

  We're The Twins from Aunt Marinn's,
            Igo and Ago.
  When Dad comes, the show begins!--
            Iram, coram, dago.

  Dad he says he named us two
            Igo and Ago
  For a poem he always knew,
            Iram, coram, dago.

  _Then_ he was a braw Scotchman--
            Igo and Ago.--
  _Now_ he's Scotch-Amer-i-can.
            Iram, coram, dago.

  "Hey!" he cries, and pats his knee,
            "Igo and Ago,
  My twin bairnies, ride wi' me--
            Iram, coram, dago!"

  "Here," he laughs, "ye've each a leg,
            Igo and Ago,
  Gleg as Tam O'Shanter's 'Meg'!
            Iram, coram, dago!"

  Then we mount, with shrieks of mirth--
            Igo and Ago,--
  The two gladdest twins on earth!
            Iram, coram, dago.

  Wade and Silas-Walker cry,--
            "Igo and Ago--
  Annie's kissin' 'em 'good-bye'!"--
            Iram, coram, dago.

  Aunty waves us fond farewells.--

  Granny pipes, "tak care yersels!"

THE LITTLE LADY


  O The Little Lady's dainty
    As the picture in a book,
  And her hands are creamy-whiter
    Than the water-lilies look;
  Her laugh's the undrown'd music
    Of the maddest meadow-brook.--
  Yet all in vain I praise The Little Lady!

  Her eyes are blue and dewy
    As the glimmering Summer-dawn,--
  Her face is like the eglantine
    Before the dew is gone;
  And were that honied mouth of hers
    A bee's to feast upon,
  He'd be a bee bewildered, Little Lady!

  Her brow makes light look sallow;
    And the sunshine, I declare,
  Is but a yellow jealousy
    Awakened by her hair--
  For O the dazzling glint of it
    Nor sight nor soul can bear,--
  So Love goes groping for The Little Lady.

  And yet she's neither Nymph nor Fay,
    Nor yet of Angelkind:--
  She's but a racing school-girl, with
    Her hair blown out behind
  And tremblingly unbraided by
    The fingers of the Wind,
  As it wildly swoops upon The Little Lady.

  They was God's people, Uncle says,
    An' gloried in His name,
  An' worked, without no selfishness,
    An' loved their neighbers same
  As they was kin: An' when they biled
    Their tree-molasses, in the Spring,
  Er butchered in the Fall, they smiled

"HIK-TEE-DIK!"

THE WAR-CRY OF BILLY AND BUDDY


[Illustration]

  When two little boys--renowned but for noise--
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!--
  May hurt a whole school, and the head it employs,
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
  Such loud and hilarious pupils indeed
  Need learning--and yet something further they need,
  Though fond hearts that love them may sorrow and bleed.
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!

  O the schoolmarm was cool, and in no wise a fool;
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
  And in ruling her ranks it was _her_ rule to _rule_;
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
  So when these two pupils conspired, every day,
  Some mad piece of mischief, with whoop and hoo-ray,
  That hurt yet defied her,--how happy were they!--
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!

  At the ring of the bell they 'd rush in with a yell--
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
  And they'd bang the school-door till the plastering fell,
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
  They'd clinch as they came, and pretend not to see
  As they knocked her desk over--then, _My!_ and _O-me!_
  How awfully sorry they'd both seem to be!
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!

[Illustration]

  This trick seemed so neat and so safe a conceit,--
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!--
  They played it three times--though the third they were beat;
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
  For the teacher, she righted her desk--raised the lid
  And folded and packed away each little kid--
  Closed the incident so--yes, and locked it, she did--
    Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!

A SESSION WITH UNCLE SIDNEY

ONE OF HIS ANIMAL STORIES


  Now, Tudens, you sit on _this_ knee--and 'scuse
  It having no side-saddle on;--and, Jeems,
  You sit on _this_--and don't you wobble so
  And chug my old shins with your coppertoes;--
  And, all the rest of you, range round someway,--
  Ride on the rockers and hang to the arms
  Of our old-time splint-bottom carryall!--
  Do anything but _squabble_ for a place,
  Or push or shove or scrouge, or breathe _out loud_,
  Or chew wet, or knead taffy in my beard!--
  Do _any_thing almost--act _any_way,--
  Only _keep still_, so I can hear myself
  Trying to tell you "just one story more!"

  One winter afternoon my father, with
  A whistle to our dog, a shout to us--
  His two boys--six and eight years old we were,--
  Started off to the woods, a half a mile
  From home, where he was chopping wood. We raced,
  We slipped and slid; reaching, at last, the north
  Side of Tharp's corn-field.--There we struck what seemed
  To be a coon-track--so we all agreed:
  And father, who was not a hunter, to
  Our glad surprise, proposed we follow it.
  The snow was quite five inches deep; and we,
  Keen on the trail, were soon far in the woods.
  Our old dog, "Ring," ran nosing the fresh track
  With whimpering delight, far on ahead.
  After following the trail more than a mile
  To northward, through the thickest winter woods
  We boys had ever seen,--all suddenly
  He seemed to strike _another_ trail; and then
  Our joyful attention was drawn to
  Old "Ring"--leaping to this side, then to that,
  Of a big, hollow, old oak-tree, which had
  Been blown down by a storm some years before.
  There--all at once--out leapt a lean old fox
  From the black hollow of a big bent limb,--
  Hey! how he scudded!--but with our old "Ring"
  Sharp after him--and father after "Ring"--
  We after father, near as we could hold!
  And father noticed that the fox kept just
  About four feet ahead of "Ring"--just _that_--
  No farther, and no nearer! Then he said:--
  "There are young foxes in that tree back there,

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: "A BIG, HOLLOW, OLD OAK-TREE, WHICH HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN
BY A STORM."]

       *       *       *       *       *

  And the mother-fox is drawing 'Ring' and us
  Away from their nest there!" "Oh, le' 's go back!--
  Do le' 's go back!" we little vandals cried,--
  "Le' 's go back, quick, and find the little things--
  _Please_, father!--Yes, and take 'em home for pets--
  'Cause 'Ring' he'll kill the old fox anyway!"
  So father turned at last, and back we went,
  And father chopped a hole in the old tree
  About ten feet below the limb from which
  The old fox ran, and--Bless their little lives!--
  There, in the hollow of the old tree-trunk--
  There, on a bed of warm dry leaves and moss--
  There, snug as any bug in any rug--
  We found--one--two--three--four, and, yes-sir, _five_
  Wee, weenty-teenty baby-foxes, with
  Their eyes just barely opened--_Cute_?--my-oh!--
  _The_ cutest--the most cunning little things
  Two boys ever saw, in all their lives!
  "Raw weather for the little fellows _now_!"
  Said father, as though talking to himself,--
  "Raw weather, and no home _now_!"--And off came
  His warm old "waumus"; and in that he wrapped
  The helpless little animals, and held
  Them soft and warm against him as he could,--
  And home we happy children followed him.--
  _Old "Ring"_ did not reach home till nearly dusk:
  The mother-fox had led him a long chase--

  "Yes, and a fool's chase, too!" he seemed to say,
  And looked ashamed to hear us _praising_ him.
  But, _mother_--well, we _could not_ understand
  _Her_ acting as she did--and we so _pleased_!
  I can see yet the look of pained surprise
  And deep compassion of her troubled face
  When father very gently laid his coat,
  With the young foxes in it, on the hearth
  Beside her, as she brightened up the fire.
  She urged--for the old fox's sake and theirs--
  That they be taken back to the old tree;
  But father--for _our_ wistful sakes, no doubt--
  Said we would keep them, and would try our best
  To raise them. And at once he set about
  Building a snug home for the little things
  Out of an old big bushel-basket, with
  Its fractured handle and its stoven ribs:
  So, lining and padding this all cosily,
  He snuggled in its little tenants, and
  Called in John Wesley Thomas, our hired man,
  And gave him in full charge, with much advice
  Regarding the just care and sustenance of
  _Young_ foxes.--"John," he said, "you feed 'em _milk_--
  _Warm_ milk, John Wesley! Yes, and _keep 'em by_
  _The stove_--and keep your stove _a-roarin'_, too,
  Both night and day!--And keep 'em _covered_ up--
  Not _smothered_, John, but snug and comfortable.--

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: "THE YOUNG FOXES IN IT, ON THE HEARTH BESIDE HER."]

       *       *       *       *       *

  And now, John Wesley Thomas, first and last,--
  You feed 'em _milk_--_fresh_ milk--and always _warm_--
  Say five or six or seven times a day--
  Of course we'll grade that by the way they _thrive_."
  But, for all sanguine hope, and care, as well,
  The little fellows _did not_ thrive at all.--
  Indeed, with _all_ our care and vigilance,
  By the third day of their captivity
  The last survivor of the fated five
  Squeaked, like some battered little rubber toy
  Just clean worn out.--And that's just what it was!

  And--nights,--the cry of the mother-fox for her young
  Was heard, with awe, for long weeks afterward.
  And we boys, every night, would go to the door
  And, peering out in the darkness, listening,
  Could hear the poor fox in the black bleak woods
  Still calling for her little ones in vain.
  As, all mutely, we returned to the warm fireside,
  Mother would say: "How would you like for _me_
  To be out there, this dark night, in the cold woods,
  Calling for _my_ children?"

SINGS A "WINKY-TOODEN" SONG--


[Illustration]

  O here's a little rhyme for the Spring- or Summer-time--
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!--
  Just a little bit o' tune you can twitter, May or June,
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!
  It's a song that soars and sings,
  As the birds that twang their wings
  Or the katydids and things
    Thus and so, don't you know,
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!

  It's a song just broken loose, with no reason or excuse--
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!
  You can sing along with it--or it matters not a bit--
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!
  It's a lovely little thing
  That 'most any one could sing
  With a ringle-dingle-ding,
    Soft and low, don't you know,
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!

  The _baby_, _she_ don't know he is.--
  'Cause she wuz only four, you know,
  He kissed her last an' hat to go!

  Pa alluz liked Sis best of all
  Us childern.--'Spect it's 'cause she fall

  An' make her back look thataway.

    And sets the foot-log quivering!
  Sing! bittern, bumble-bee, and dove--
    Sing! Sing! Sing!

  Sing as you will, O singers all
    Who sing because you _want_ to sing!
  Sing! peacock on the orchard wall,
    Or tree-toad by the trickling spring!
  Sing! every bird on every bough--
    Sing! every living, loving thing--
  Sing any song, and anyhow,
    But Sing! Sing! Sing!

    Of all the birds they is!

  An' when he' lights an' shuts his wings,
    His coat's a "cutaway"--
  I guess it's only when he sings
    You'd know he wuz a jay.

  I like to watch him when he's lit
    In top of any tree,
  'Cause all birds git wite out of it
    When _he_ 'lights, an' they see
  How proud he act', an' swell an' spread
    His chest out more an' more,
  An' raise the feathers on his head
    Like it's cut pompadore!

  Wuz two Bears an' their two boys:
  An' the two boys' names, you know,
  Wuz--like _ours_ is,--Jim an' Jo;
  An' their _parunts'_ names wuz same's,
  All big grown-up people's names,--
  Ist _Miz_ Bear, the neighbers call
  'Em, an' _Mister_ Bear--'at's all.
  Yes--an' Miz Bear scold him, too,
  Ist like grown folks _shouldn't_ do!

[Illustration]

  Wuz a grea'-big river there,
  An', 'crosst that, 's a mountain where
  Old Bear said some day he'd go,
  Ef she don't quit scoldin'so!
  So, one day when he been down
  The river, fishin', 'most to town,
  An' come back 'thout no fish a-tall,
  An' Jim an' Jo they run an' bawl
  An' tell their ma their pa hain't fetch'
  No fish,--she scold again an' ketch
  Her old broom up an' biff him, too.--

[Illustration]

  An' he ist cry, an' say, "_Boo-hoo_!
  I _told_ you what I 'd do some day'."
  An' he ist turned an' runned away
  To where's the grea'-big river there,
  An' ist _splunged_ in an' swum to where
  The mountain's at, 'way th'other side,
  An' clumbed up there. An' Miz Bear _cried_--
  An' little Jo an' little Jim--
  Ist like their ma--bofe cried fer him!--
  But he clumbed on, _clean out o' sight_,
  He wuz so mad!--An' served 'em right!

  Nen--when the Bear got 'way on top
  The mountain, he heerd somepin' flop
  Its wings--an' somepin' else he heerd
  A-rattlin'-like.--An' he wuz _skeerd_,
  An' looked 'way up, an'--_Mercy sake!_--

  It wuz a' Eagul an' a SNAKE!
  An'-sir! the Snake, he bite an' kill'
  The Eagul, an' they bofe fall till
  They strike the ground--_k'spang-k'spat!_--
  Wite where the Bear wuz standin' at!
  An' when here come the Snake at him,
  The Bear he think o' little Jim
  An' Jo, he did--an' their ma, too,--
  All safe at home; an' he ist flew
  Back down the mountain--an' could hear
  The old Snake rattlin', sharp an' clear,
  Wite clos't behind!--An' Bear he's so
  All tired out, by time, you know,
  He git down to the river there,
  He know' he can't _swim_ back to where
  His folks is at. But ist wite nen
  He see a boat an' six big men

[Illustration]

  'At's been a-shootin' ducks: An' so
  He skeerd them out the boat, you know,
  An' ist jumped in--an' Snake _he_ tried
  To jump in, too, but failed outside
  Where all the water wuz; an' so
  The Bear grabs one the things you row
  The boat wiv an' ist whacks the head
  Of the old Snake an' kills him dead!--

  An' when he's killed him dead, w'y, nen
  _The old Snake's drownded dead again_!
  Nen Bear set in the boat an' bowed
  His back an' rowed--an' rowed--an' rowed--
  Till he's safe home--so tired he can't
  Do nothin' but lay there an' pant
  An' tell his childern, "Bresh my coat!"
  An' tell his wife, "Go chain my boat!"
  An' they're so glad he's back, they say
  "They _knowed_ he's comin' thataway
  To ist surprise the dear ones there!"
  An' Jim an' Jo they dried his hair

[Illustration]

  An' pulled the burrs out; an' their ma
  She ist set there an' helt his paw
  Till he wuz sound asleep, an' nen
  She tell' him she won't scold again--
      Never--never--never--
      Ferever an' ferever!

  Little Julia, since that we
  May not as our elders be,
  Let us blithely fill the days
  Of our youth with pleasant plays.
  First we'll up at earliest dawn,
  While as yet the dew is on
  The sooth'd grasses and the pied
  Blossomings of morningtide;
  Next, with rinsed cheeks that shine
  As the enamell'd eglantine,
  We will break our fast on bread
  With both cream and honey spread;
  Then, with many a challenge-call,
  We will romp from house and hall,
  Gypsying with the birds and bees
  Of the green-tress'd garden trees.
  In a bower of leaf and vine
  Thou shalt be a lady fine
  Held in duress by the great
  Giant I shall personate.
  Next, when many mimics more
  Like to these we have played o'er,

[Illustration]

  We'll betake us home-along
  Hand in hand at evensong.

THE DOLLY'S MOTHER

[W.W.]


  A little maid, of summers four--
    Did you compute her years,--
  And yet how infinitely more
    To me her age appears:

  I mark the sweet child's serious air,
    At her unplayful play,--
  The tiny doll she mothers there
    And lulls to sleep away,

  Grows--'neath the grave similitude--
    An infant real, to me,
  And _she_ a saint of motherhood
    In hale maturity.

[Illustration]

  So, pausing in my lonely round,
    And all unseen of her,
  I stand uncovered--her profound
    And abject worshipper.

  The shutters up and the shutters down!
    Wind of the Sea, sweep over the bay
      And bear me away!--away!

  Whither you bear me, Wind of the Sea,
  Matters never the least to me:
    Give me your fogs, with the sails adrip,
  Or the weltering path thro' the starless night--
  On, somewhere, is a new daylight
    And the cheery glint of another ship
      As its colors dip and dip!

BORN TO THE PURPLE

[W.M.]


  Most-like it was this kingly lad
  Spake out of the pure joy he had
  In his child-heart of the wee maid
  Whose eerie beauty sudden laid
  A spell upon him, and his words
  Burst as a song of any bird's:--

  A peerless Princess thou shalt be,
  Through wit of love's rare sorcery:
  To crown the crown of thy gold hair
  Thou shalt have rubies, bleeding there
  Their crimson splendor midst the marred
  Pulp of great pearls, and afterward

[Illustration]

  Leaking in fainter ruddy stains
  Adown thy neck-and-armlet-chains
  Of turquoise, chrysoprase, and mad
  Light-frenzied diamonds, dartling glad
  Swift spirts of shine that interfuse
  As though with lucent crystal dews
  That glance and glitter like split rays
  Of sunshine, born of burgeoning Mays
  When the first bee tilts down the lip
  Of the first blossom, and the drip
  Of blended dew and honey heaves
  Him blinded midst the underleaves.
  For raiment, Fays shall weave for thee--
  Out of the phosphor of the sea
  And the frayed floss of starlight, spun
  With counterwarp of the firm sun--
  A vesture of such filmy sheen
  As, through all ages, never queen
  Therewith strove truly to make less
  One fair line of her loveliness.
  Thus gowned and crowned with gems and gold,
  Thou shalt, through centuries untold,
  Rule, ever young and ever fair,
  As now thou rulest, smiling there.

OLD MAN WHISKERY-WHEE-KUM-WHEEZE


  Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze
  Lives 'way up in the leaves o' trees.
  An' wunst I slipped up-stairs to play
  In Aunty's room, while she 'uz away;
  An' I clumbed up in her cushion-chair
  An' ist peeked out o' the winder there;
  An' there I saw--wite out in the trees--
  Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze!

  An' Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze
  Would bow an' bow, with the leaves in the breeze,
  An' waggle his whiskers an' raggledy hair,
  An' bow to me in the winder there!
  An' I 'd peek out, an' he'd peek in
  An' waggle his whiskers an' bow ag'in,
  Ist like the leaves'u'd wave in the breeze--
  Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze!

  An' Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze,
  Seem-like, says to me: "See my bees
  A-bringin' my dinner? An' see my cup
  O' locus'-blossoms they've plum' filled up?"
  An' "_Um-yum, honey!_" wuz last he said,
  An' waggled his whiskers an' bowed his head;
  An' I yells, "Gimme some, won't you, please,
  Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze?"

THE TREASURE OF THE WISE MAN


  O the night was dark and the night was late,
    And the robbers came to rob him;
  And they picked the locks of his palace-gate,
    The robbers that came to rob him--
  They picked the locks of his palace-gate,
  Seized his jewels and gems of state,
  His coffers of gold and his priceless plate,--
    The robbers that came to rob him.

  But loud laughed he in the morning red!--
    For of what had the robbers robbed him?--
  Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,
    When the robbers came to rob him,--
  They robbed him not of a golden shred
  Of the childish dreams in his wise old head--
  "And they're welcome to all things else," he said,
    When the robbers came to rob him.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
