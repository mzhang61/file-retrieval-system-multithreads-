Hymn 1.                                                            L. M.

                 "_All people that on earth do dwell._"


    All people that on earth do dwell,
      Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
    Him serve with fear, his praise forth tell,
      Come ye before him and rejoice.

  2 The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;
      Without our aid he did us make;
    We are his flock, he doth us feed;
      And for his sheep he doth us take.

  3 O enter then his gates with praise,
      Approach with joy his courts unto:
    Praise, laud and bless his name always;
      For it is seemly so to do.

  4 For why? The Lord our God is good;
      His mercy is for ever sure;
    His truth at all times firmly stood;
      And shall from age to age endure.

  5 Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
      Praise him, all creatures here below;
    Praise him above, ye heavenly host;
      Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

    All hail the power of Jesus' name;
      Let angels prostrate fall!
    Bring forth the royal diadem,
      And crown him Lord of all!

  2 Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,
      A remnant weak and small.
    Hail him, who saves you by his grace,
      And crown him Lord of all!

  3 Ye Gentile sinners, ne'er forget
      The wormwood and the gall;
    Go, spread your trophies at his feet,
      And crown him Lord of all!

  4 Let ev'ry kindred, ev'ry tribe,
      On this terrestrial ball,
    To him all majesty ascribe,
      And crown him Lord of all!

  5 O that with yonder sacred throng,
      We at his feet may fall;
    We'll join the everlasting song,
      And crown him Lord of all!

Hymn 3.

                   "_Pass me not, O gentle Saviour._"


    Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
      Hear my humble cry;
    While on others thou art calling,
      Do not pass me by.

  Chorus:--
    Saviour, Saviour, hear my humble cry;
      While on others thou art calling,
    Do not pass me by.

  2 Let me at a throne of mercy
      Find a sweet relief;
    Kneeling there in deep contrition,
      Help my unbelief.

  3 Trusting only in thy merit,
      Would I seek thy face;
    Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
      Save me by thy grace.

  4 Thou the spring of all my comfort,
      More than life to me:
    Whom have I on earth beside thee?
      Whom in heaven but thee?

  5 Pass me not, O gentle Saviour
      Thou canst make me see;
    Thy salvation, Jesus, Saviour!
      Speak some word to me.

                "_Lord, I hear of showers of blessing._"


    Lord, I hear of showers of blessing
      Thou art scattering full and free--
    Showers the thirsty land refreshing;
      Let some droppings fall on me--

  Chorus.--E-ven me, e-ven me,
            Let thy blessing fall on me.

  2 Pass me not, O gracious Father!
      Sinful though my heart may be;
    Thou might'st leave me, but the rather
      Let Thy mercy fall on me.

  3 Pass me not, O tender Saviour!
      Let me love and cling to Thee;
    I am longing for Thy favor;
      Whilst Thou'rt calling, oh, call me.

  4 Pass me not, O mighty Spirit!
      Thou can'st make the blind to see;
    Witnesser of Jesus' merit.
      Speak the word of power to me.

  5 Love of God, so pure and changeless;
      Blood of Christ, so rich and free;
    Grace of God, so strong and boundless,
      Magnify them all in me.

    For ever with the Lord:
      Amen, so let it be,
    Life from the dead is in that word,
      'Tis immortality.

  2 Here in the body pent,
      Absent from him I roam,
    Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
      A day's march nearer home.

  3 My Father's house on high,
      Home of my soul, how near
    At times to faith's foreseeing eye
      Thy golden gates appear!

  4 Ah, then my spirit faints
      To reach the land I love,
    The bright inheritance of saints,
      Jerusalem above.

  5 I hear at morn and even,
      At noon and midnight hour,
    The choral harmonies of heaven
      Earth's Babel-tongues o'erpower.

  6 That resurrection word,
      That shout of victory,
    Once more, For ever with the Lord:
      Amen, so let it be.

    Awake, my soul, and with the sun
    Thy daily stage of duty run:
    Shake off dull sloth, and early rise,
    To pay thy morning sacrifice.

  2 Redeem thy misspent moments past,
    And live this day as if thy last;
    Thy talents to improve take care;
    For the great day thyself prepare.

  3 Let all thy converse be sincere,
    Thy conscience as the noonday clear;
    For God's all-seeing eye surveys
    Thy secret thoughts, thy words and ways.

  4 Wake, and lift up thyself, my heart,
    And with the angels take thy part;
    Who all night long unwearied sing
    High glory to the eternal King.

    Praise him above, ye heavenly host;

    Glory to thee, my God, this night,

    Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
    Beneath thine own almighty wings!

  2 Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear son,
    The ill that I this day have done;
    That with the world, myself and thee,
    I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

  3 Teach me to live, that I may dread
    The grave as little as my bed;
    Teach me to die, that so I may
    Rise glorious at the awful day.

  4 O let my soul on thee repose!
    And may sweet sleep mine eyelids close;
    Sleep that shall me more vigorous make
    To serve my God when I awake.

  5 If in the night I sleepless lie,
    My soul with heavenly thoughts supply;
    Let no ill dreams disturb my rest,
    No powers of darkness me molest.

    Praise Him, all creatures here below;
    Praise him above, ye heavenly host;

           "_While shepherds watch'd their flocks by night._"


    While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
      All seated on the ground,
    The angel of the Lord came down,
      And glory shone around.

  2 "Fear not," said he, (for mighty dread
      Had seized their troubled mind,)
    "Glad tidings of great joy I bring
      To you and all mankind.

  3 "To you in David's town this day
      Is born, of David's line,
    The Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;
      And this shall be the sign:

  4 "The heavenly babe you there shall find
      To human view display'd,
    All meanly wrapp'd in swathing bands,
      And in a manger laid."

  5 Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
      Appear'd a shining throng
    Of angels praising God, on high,
      And thus addressed their song:

  6 "All glory be to God on high,
      And to the earth be peace;
    Good will henceforth, from heaven to men,
      Begin and never cease."

                  "_There is a land of pure delight._"


    There is a land of pure delight,
      Where saints immortal reign:
    Infinite day excludes the night,
      And pleasures banish pain.

  2 There everlasting spring abides,
      And never-withr'ing flowers:
    Death like a narrow sea divides
      That heavenly land from ours.

  3 Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood
      Stand dressed in living green:
    So to the Jews fair Canaan stood,
      While Jordan roll'd between.

  4 But tim'rous mortals start and shrink
      To cross that narrow sea;
    And linger shiv'ring on the brink,
      And fear to launch away.

  5 O could we make our doubts remove,
      Those gloomy doubts that rise,
    And see the Canaan that we love,
      With unbeclouded eyes!

  6 Could we but climb where Moses stood,
      And view the landscape o'er,
    Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,
      Should fright us from the shore.

                 "_O for a thousand tongues to sing._"


    O for a thousand tongues to sing
      My great Redeemer's praise!
    The glories of my God and King,
      The triumphs of his grace.

  2 My gracious Master, and my God,
      Assist me to proclaim,
    To spread through all the earth abroad
      The honours of Thy name.

  3 Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
      That bids our sorrows cease;
    'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
      'Tis life, and health, and peace.

  4 He breaks the power of cancell'd sin;
      He sets the pris'ner free;
    His blood can make the foulest clean;
      His blood avail'd for me.

  5 Look unto Him, ye nations; own
      Your God, ye fallen race;
    Look and be saved through faith alone;
      Be justified by grace.

  6 See all your sins on Jesus laid;
      The Lamb of God was slain;
    His soul was once an off'ring made
      For every soul of man.

    How bright these glorious spirits shine!
      Whence all their white array?
    How came they to the blissful seats
      Of everlasting day?

  2 Lo! these are they, from sufferings great,
      Who came to realms of light;
    And in the blood of Christ have wash'd
      Those robes, which shine so bright.

  3 Now, with triumphant palms, they stand
      Before the throne on high
    And serve the God they love, amidst
      The glories of the sky,

  4 His presence fills each heart with joy,
      Tunes every mouth to sing;
    By day, by night, the sacred courts
      With glad Hosannas ring.

  5 The Lamb, which dwells amidst the throne,
      Shall o'er them still preside,
    Feed them with nourishment divine,
      And all their footsteps guide.

  6 In pastures green He'll lead his flock
      Where living streams appear;
    And God the Lord from every eye
      Shall wipe off every tear.

      Swell the triumph of his train;
          Hallelujah!
      God appears on earth to reign.

  2 Every eye shall now behold him,
      Robed in dreadful majesty;
    Those who set at nought and sold him,
      Pierced and nailed him to the tree,
          Deeply wailing,
      Shall the true Messiah see.

  3 Now redemption, long expected,
      See in solemn pomp appear;
    All his saints, by men rejected,
      Now shall meet him in the air;
          Hallelujah!
      See the day of God appear.

  4 Yea, Amen; let all adore thee,
      High on thine eternal throne;
    Saviour, take the power and glory;
      Claim the kingdom for thine own.

                    "_Rock of Ages, cleft for me._"


    Rock of ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in thee!
    Let the water and the blood,
    From thy riven side which flow'd,
    Be of sin the double cure,
    Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

  2 Not the labours of my hands,
    Can fulfil thy law's demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears for ever flow;
    All for sin could not atone,
    Thou must save, and thou alone.

  3 Nothing in my hand I bring,
    Simply to thy cross I cling;
    Naked, come to thee for dress;
    Helpless, look to thee for grace;
    Foul, I to the fountain fly;
    Wash me, Saviour, or I die!

  4 While I draw this fleeting breath,
    When my eyelids close in death,
    When I soar to worlds unknown,
    See thee on thy judgment throne,
    Rock of ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in thee!

    How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
      In a believer's ear;
    It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
      And drives away his fear.

  2 It makes the wounded spirit whole,
      And calms the troubled breast;
    'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
      And to the weary, rest.

  3 Dear name, the rock on which I build,
      My shield and hiding-place;
    My never-failing treasury, fill'd
      With boundless stores of grace.

  4 Jesu, my Shepherd, Husband, Friend,
      My Prophet, Priest and King,
    My Lord, my life, my way, my end,--
      Accept the praise I bring.

  5 Weak is the effort of my heart,
      And cold my warmest thought;
    But, when I see thee as thou art,
      I'll praise thee as I ought.

  6 Till then I would thy love proclaim
      With every fleeting breath;
    And may the music of thy name
      Refresh my soul in death.

    "Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou me?"

  2 I deliver'd thee when bound,
    And when bleeding, heal'd thy wound;
    Sought thee wandering, set thee right,
    Turned thy darkness into light.

  3 Can a woman's tender care
    Cease towards the child she bare?
    Yes, she may forgetful be,
    Yet will I remember thee.

  4 Mine is an unchanging love,
    Higher than the heights above,
    Deeper than the depths beneath,
    Free and faithful, strong as death.

  5 Thou shalt see my glory soon,
    When the work of grace is done:
    Partner of my throne shalt be,
    "Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou me?"

  6 Lord, it is my chief complaint
    That my love is cold and faint:
    Yet I love thee, and adore;

    The gates of brass before him burst,
      The iron fetters yield.

  4 He comes from thickest films of vice
      To clear the mental ray,
    And on the eye balls of the blind
      To pour celestial day.

  5 He comes the broken heart to bind,
      The bleeding soul to cure;
    And with the treasures of his grace

    And shall I fear to own his cause,
      Or blush to speak his name?

  2 Must I be carried to the skies
      On flowery beds of ease;
    While others fought to win the prize,
      And sail'd through bloody seas?

  3 Are there no foes for me to face?
      Must I not stem the flood?
    Is this vile world a friend to grace,
      To help me on to God?

  4 Sure, I must fight, if I would reign;
      Increase my courage, Lord;
    I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
      Supported by thy word.

  5 Thy saints in all this glorious war
      Shall conquer, though they die;
    They see the triumph from afar,
      By faith they bring it nigh.

    In robes of victory through the skies,
      The glory shall be thine.

                    "_Come, ye who love the Lord._"


    Come, ye who love the Lord,
      And let your joys be known;
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
      And thus surround the throne.

  2 Let those refuse to sing
      That never knew our God,
    But children of the heavenly King
      May speak their joys abroad.

  3 Children of grace have found
      Glory begun below:
    Celestial fruits on earthly grounds
      From faith and hope may grow.

  4 The hill of Sion yields
      A thousand sacred sweets,
    Before we reach the heavenly fields,
      Or walk the golden streets.

  5 Then let our songs abound,
      And every tear be dry;
    We're marching through Immanuel's ground,
      To fairer worlds on high.

                "_Come, thou Fount of every blessing._"


    Come, thou Fount of every blessing,
      Tune my heart to sing thy grace;
    Streams of mercy never ceasing,
      Call for songs of loudest praise.

  2 Teach me some melodious sonnet,
      Sung by flaming tongues above;
    Praise the mount--I'm fix'd upon it:
      Mount of thy redeeming love!

  3 Here I raise mine Ebenezer,
      Hither by thy help I'm come;
    And I hope, by thy good pleasure,
      Safely to arrive at home.

  4 Jesus sought me when a stranger,
      Wand'ring from the fold of God;
    He, to rescue me from danger,
      Interposed his precious blood.

  5 O! to grace how great a debtor
      Daily I'm constrained to be!
    Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
      Bind my wand'ring heart to thee:

  6 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
      Prone to leave the God I love--
    Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
      Seal it for thy courts above!

                 "_Sun of my Soul! Thou Saviour dear._"


    Sun of my soul! Thou Saviour dear,
    It is not night if thou be near;
    Oh! may no earth born cloud arise
    To hide thee from thy servant's eyes.

  2 When the soft dews of kindly sleep
    My wearied eyelids gently steep,
    Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
    For ever on my Saviour's breast.

  3 Abide with me from morn till eve,
    For without thee I cannot live;
    Abide with me when night is nigh,
    For without thee I dare not die.

  4 If some poor wandering child of thine
    Has spurned, to-day, the voice divine,
    Now, Lord, the gracious work begin;
    Let him no more lie down in sin.

  5 Watch by the sick; enrich the poor
    With blessings from thy boundless store;
    Be every mourner's sleep to-night
    Like infant slumbers, pure and light.

  6 Come near and bless us when we wake,
    Ere through the world our way we take,
    Till in the ocean of thy love
    We lose ourselves in heav'n above.

    Joy to the world! The Lord is come!

    Let every heart prepare him room,
      And heaven and nature sing.

  2 Joy to the earth! The Saviour reigns!
      Let men their songs employ;
    While fields, and floods, rocks, hills and plains
      Repeat the sounding joy.

  3 While fields, and floods, rocks, hills and plains
      Repeat the sounding joy;
    Joy to the earth! The Saviour reigns;
      Let men their songs employ.

  4 No more let sins and sorrows grow,
      Nor thorns infest the ground;
    He comes to make his blessings flow,
      Far as the curse is found.

  5 He rules the world with truth and grace,
      And makes the nations prove
    The glories of his righteousness,
      And wonders of his love.

    My soul has often found relief;
    And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
    By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

  2 Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
    Thy wings shall my petition bear,
    To him whose truth and faithfulness,
    Engage the waiting soul to bless;
    And since he bids me seek his face,
    Believe his word, and trust his grace,
    I'll cast on him my every care,
    And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

  3 Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
    May I thy consolation share;
    Till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
    I view my home and take my flight.
    This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise
    To seize the everlasting prize;
    And shout, while passing through the air,
    Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!

    Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

  2 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
    Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away,
    Change and decay in all around I see;
    O thou, who changest not, abide with me.

  3 I need thy presence every passing hour;
    What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
    Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?
    Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

  4 I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless;
    Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness,
    Where is death's sting? where grave, thy victory?
    I triumph still, if thou abide with me.

  5 Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes;
    Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
    Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
    In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

                  "_I heard the voice of Jesus say._"


    I heard the voice of Jesus say,
      "Come unto me and rest;
    Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
      Thy head upon my breast."

  2 I came to Jesus as I was--
      Weary, and worn, and sad;
    I found in him a resting place,
      And he has made me glad.

  3 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
      "Behold I freely give
    The living water--thirsty one
      Stoop down, and drink, and live."

  4 I came to Jesus, and I drank
      Of that life-giving stream;
    My thirst was quench'd, my soul reviv'd
      And now I live in him.

  5 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
      "I am this dark world's light;
    Look unto me, thy morn shall rise,
      And all thy day be bright."

  6 I looked to Jesus, and I found
      In him my Star, my Sun;
    And in that Light of Life I'll walk
      Till earthly days are done.

      O come, Great Spirit, come.

  2 Come as the light; to us reveal
      Our emptiness and woe:
    And lead us in those paths of life,
      Where all the righteous go.

  3 Come as the fire, and purge our hearts
      Like sacrificial flame;
    Let our whole soul an offering be
      To our Redeemer's name.

  4 Come as the dew, and sweetly bless
      This consecrated hour;
    May barrenness rejoice to own
      Thy fertilizing power.

  5 Come as the dove, and spread thy wings,
      The wings of peaceful love;
    And let thy church on earth become
      Bless'd as the church above.

  6 Spirit Divine, attend our prayers;
      Make a lost world thy home;
    Descend with all thy gracious powers,

    Jerusalem, my happy home,
      Name ever dear to me,
    When shall my labours have an end
      In joy, and peace, and thee?

  2 When shall these eyes thy heavenly walls,
      And pearly gates behold,
    Thy bulwarks with salvation strong,
      And streets of shining gold?

  3 There happier bowers than Eden's bloom,
      Nor sin nor sorrow know:
    Blest seats! 'mid rude and stormy scenes,
      I onward press to you.

  4 Why should I shrink from pain and woe,
      Or feel at death dismay?
    I've Canaan's goodly land in view,
      And realms of endless day.

  5 Apostles, martyrs, prophets, there,
      Around my Saviour stand,
    And soon my friends in Christ below
      Will join the glorious band.

  6 Jerusalem, my happy home,
      My soul still pants for thee:
    Then shall my labours have an end,
      When I thy joys shall see.

Hymn 31.

                   "_Shall we gather at the river._"


    Shall we gather at the river
      Where bright angel feet have trod;
    With its crystal tide for ever
      Flowing by the throne of God?

    Cho.--Yes, we'll gather at the river,
          The beautiful, the beautiful river--
          Gather with the saints at the river,
          That flows by the throne of God.

  2 On the margin of the river,
      Washing up its golden spray,
    We will walk and worship ever
      All the happy, golden day.

  3 Ere we reach the shining river,
      Lay we every burden down;
    Grace our spirits will deliver
      And provide a robe and crown.

  4 At the smiling of the river,
      Mirror of the Saviour's face,
    Saints whom death will never sever,
      Lift their songs of saving grace.

  5 Soon we'll reach the shining river,
      Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
    Soon our happy hearts will quiver
      With the melody of peace.

  2 We shall sing on that beautiful shore,
      The melodious songs of the blest,
    And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
      Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

  3 To our bountiful Father above,
      We will offer our tribute of praise,
    For the glorious gift of his love,
      And the blessings that hallow our days.

  4 We shall meet, we shall sing, we shall reign,
      In the land where the saved never die;
    We shall rest free from sorrow and pain,
      Safe at home in the sweet bye and bye.

    My faith looks up to thee,
    Thou Lamb of Calvary,
        Saviour divine;
    Now hear me while I pray,
    Take all my guilt away,
    O let me from this day
        Be wholly thine.

  2 May thy rich grace impart
    Strength to my fainting heart,
        My zeal inspire:
    As thou hast died for me,
    O may my love to thee
    Pure, warm, and changeless be,
        A living fire.

  3 While life's dark maze I tread,
    And griefs around me spread,
        Be thou my guide;
    Bid darkness turn to day,
    Wipe sorrow's tears away,
    Nor let me ever stray
        From thee aside.

  4 When ends life's transient dream,
    When death's cold sullen stream
        Shall o'er me roll;
    Blest Saviour, then in love
    Fear and distrust remove;
    O bear me safe above,
        A ransom'd soul.

    Nearer, my God, to Thee,

      Cleaving the sky,

    Nearer, my God, to Thee,
    Nearer, my God, to Thee,
      Nearer to Thee.

                    "_Gentle Jesu, Meek and Mild._"


    Gentle Jesu, meek and mild,
    Look upon a little child;
    Pity my simplicity,
    Suffer me to come to thee.

  2 Fain I would to thee be brought;
    Dearest Lord, forbid it not;
    Give me, dearest Lord, a place
    In the kingdom of thy grace.

  3 Lamb of God, I look to thee;
    Thou shalt my example be;
    Thou are gentle, meek and mild,
    Thou wast once a little child.

  4 Loving Jesu, gentle Lamb,
    In thy gracious hands I am;
    Make me, Saviour, what thou art,
    Live thyself within my heart.

be renamed.

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
